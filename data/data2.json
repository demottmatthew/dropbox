        "DESCRIPTION": "EZ-Flat Rocker- Flat camber profile with gently rockered nose and tail just outside of the inserts makes for a smooth and stable ride by reducing chatter. Trutwin-Identical nose and tail shape and lengths, combined with an equally designed woodcore profile, allows for a balanced ride whether ridden regular or switch. Freestyle your way through any park, pipe or all over the mountain. Biaxial-A smooth, easy, torsional feel, the majority of the fibers are in the 0 axis to add extra pop and an easy torsional flex to the board. Easy carving for all-mountain or park performance. Truflex-Similar to the ReFlex core, TruFlex core technology features a high strength-to-weight wood construction utilizing different density poplar woods uniquely profiled to give you excellent all-around response when riding the mountain. EZDT Sidecut-Designed for EZ-Rock and another version of EZ FlatRock, the EZDT is mellow between the bindings and at the tips with a more aggressive grip in the binding areas. This creates a more forgiving ride when things get a bit bumpy and a tight radius blended for quick carves. Optix 2000-A high-density, extruded base that is extremely easy to maintain and fix. The Optix 2000 is one of the highest wax absorbing bases on the market and will give you all the speed you need even if you don\u2019t wax on a regular basis.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Strap into the Rome Women's Lo-Fi Rocker Snowboard if you don't discriminate between sending big jumps in the park and slashing fresh powder in the trees. This poppy, yet playful freestyle deck features balanced twin geometry for riding switch without compromise in the park. However, just because the Lo-Fi Rocker excels at jumps and jibs doesn't mean it can't slay the entire mountain. It's equally adept at dropping into open bowls and dicing up deep glades on powder days thanks to its FreePop Rocker. The FreePop Rocker profile keeps the tips from submerging, should you find yourself riding on powder days and stomping landings in untracked snow. This hybrid profile places flat camber underfoot for a stable, predictable feel when you're straight-lining kickers and hauling at high speeds. Just after the binding inserts, the board transitions to rocker to the tip and tail, allowing you to float through fresh snow, as well as link turns and stomp landings without catching unexpectedly. Inside this freestyle specialist, the snappy Pop Core Matrix blends long poplar wood with three zones of low-density wood. The StraightBiax Laminate preserves the board's playful nature, allowing you to flex the board torsionally for effortless butters and presses. Helping you boost over slow signs (don't get caught!) and clear kickers, the Bamboo Single Barrel HotRod is milled directly into the nose and tail for spring-like response.",

As such, he went with the Gang Plank when choosing which board to base his pro model off. The Rome Gang Plank x Len Snowboard is the same versatile freestyle machine you already know, just with custom graphics to honor Len's urban accomplishments of the last few years. A mostly flat profile keeps it stable and predictable when hitting rails and sending jumps, with rocker at the tips for a bit of forgiveness and float. A bamboo rod milled into the core adds snap for bigger ollies and more dynamic turns. The QuickRip sidecut features additional contact points near the bindings that allow the board to feel loose at low speeds while still maintaining edge hold at speed. Rome also added Basalt Impact Plates under the inserts to prevent blowouts when you're repeatedly gapping to rails in the city.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Based on the legendary pow-specific shape of Salomon's Derby Snowboard, the Salomon Split Splitboard keeps you floating on snorkel-deep days with its tapered twin shape and Flat Out Rocker profile. While most split boards feature a directional shape, the Salomon Split keeps you centered along the effective edge with a slightly pulled-in tail for easy float without sacrificing its ability to grip on hardpack, should you encounter sketchy snow in the backcountry. The 147 and 156-centimeter boards feature 10-millimeters of taper, while the 162-centimeter board has 12-millimeters of taper for a bit more float. Available in three distinct sizes, the 147-centimeter Split uses Salomon's Rocket Science shaping, allowing you to ride a much smaller board in the backcountry for less fatigue on the skin up. This unique shaping widens the board for enhanced float without the weight of a longer board, giving you a downsized rocket for slicing through tight trees and chutes. Inside this backcountry ripper, you'll find an Aspen SLCT core that's composed of FSC-certified wood for lightweight performance. Popster core profiling gives the Split extra boost when you're snapping ollies, while rugged ABS sidewalls withstand regular thrashings when you're clanking 'em together in touring mode or bumping into branches and stumps. Additionally, you'll find Salomon's fastest Sintered EG base that's finished with Electra for unparalleled glide over a wide variety of snow conditions in the backcountry. Note that the Split comes with custom skins to maximize touring efficiency.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "While taking the Bataleon Airobic Snowboard through the park and crushing every feature in your path takes almost no effort, it is still technically exercise, so don't feel like you haven't earned those apres beers at the end of the day. With Triple Base Technology (TBT), the Airobic's profile starts with traditional camber for reliable pop and edge hold, then turns the edges up toward the tip and tail to eliminate hang-ups when riding flat base, maintaining that forgiving feel of rocker without sacrificing the benefits of camber. Park 3BT features a mellow version of camber for a looser feel on rails and stability on big jumps. A true twin shape allows for unrestricted switch riding, and blunt tips keep the swing weight down. Biax glass gives the board a soft, even flex for proper presses and easy turns. The Core Core uses poplar wood for pop and power, while the added beech hardwood runs from tip-to-tail for comfortable lateral flex and added strength to the board's backbone. KEVLAR stringers in key areas make the Airobic lighter and snappier, much like carbon, except stronger and more responsive. It's finished off with a sintered base for impact-resistance and rocket-fast speeds.",

New for this season, this board is up for whatever you feel like doing on any given day, whether that's taking park laps, cruising side hits, finding freshies in the trees, or carving up groomers. FreePop Rocker features a stable flat profile that won't feel washy at high speeds and rockered tips to prevent hang-ups on hardpack and enhance float in powder. Even though it has a twin shape, the stance is slightly set-back to offer more control for progressing riders. A Hotrods Single Glass Barrel helps you pop big ollies, and the QuickRip sidecut features additional contact points near the bindings that allow the board to feel loose at low speeds while still maintaining edge hold at speed. The strong, snappy poplar core keeps the board lightweight, and biax glass provides a consistent flex for smooth turns. It's all finished off with an extruded base that's easy to repair after you beat it up in the park.",

A specially formulated blend of rocker and camber combines big-mountain power with park-friendly playfulness. Subtly raised edges mean less edge-catching, more fluid edge-to-edge transitions, and a surfy feel in powder. It also has a true twin shape for unrestricted switch trickery around the mountain. Inside this aggressive all-terrain twin, you'll find a Wood C/K core with carbon and aramid for extra pop and vibration dampening. Magne-Traction 5S edges sport five bumps on each edge for insane edge hold on the iciest days of the year. Add in a super-fast Sintered 4400 base, and you have a board that's ready to crush steeps and launch kickers at high speeds.",

Instilling plenty of snap into this versatile freestyle ride, the Pop Core Matrix consists of two zones of lightweight wood combined with poplar wood for a light and lively feel. StraightBiax carbon laminates enhance energy transfer for more powerful turns and ollies. And if that wasn't enough pop for you, Rome milled a bamboo rod into the core to help ensure you clear those slow signs.

A mostly flat profile keeps it stable for sending jumps and locking onto rails and rocker at the tips provide a catch-free feel on hardpack and enhanced float in powder. The easy-going flex helps you perfect your presses andt is still responsive enough for hitting jumps and laying down carves. Speaking of carving, 2X Traction bumps along the side on the board add extra grip when you and the crew decide to go for some high-speed groomer runs.",

Now utilizing the CRCX camber story (full rocker in the center and mild camber in the tip and tail) the Roots CRCX rides loose, free and fun in flats, while providing maximum hold when carving. The DD2 Core, the lightest core in our line, is made up of tip to tail Poplar with high density stringers through the center of the board, creating explosive pop and response! Groomers, deeps, steeps, chutes, glades, the Roots will dominate them all. The biradial sidecut slices into even sheet ice and holds its line, while the slightly raised contact points help avoid those nasty edge grab takedowns. Biax on top Triax underneath, rubber foil to dampen the landings on the big hits, Full tip to tip edge to edge Poplar core, Rockwell inserts, and ABS sidewalls. This is a dream construction. Profile: CRCX Full rocker in the center to free up your contact points for catch free riding and serious float in powder, is then paired with mild camber in the tip and tail for explosive pop and tons of added control. Construction: DD2 Core The new DD2 core is the lightest core in our line. Featuring hand selected Poplar that runs tip to tail, there\u2019s no particle board, presswood, wafers, or other inferior products that you find in many of the other boards on the market. We then add high density wood stringers that run through the middle of the board to add increased response and explosive pop. A true all mountain core with maximum durability! Outline: Directional Twin Inserts set slightly back on the board allow for exceptional float in powder and intense performance in the most challenging terrain while allowing riders to still easily ride switch should they choose. Warranty: 3 Years A three year warranty against manufacturer defects allows you to charge and know that this board will perform for years to come.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "From slushy park laps to fresh tree runs, the Nitro Women's Fate Flat Out Snowboard destroys everything on the mountain with its extremely stable, more forgiving Flat Out Profile. Taking the edge off the board's responsive flex, the totally flat profile ensures high-speed stability and easy-carving prowess without being as catchy as traditional camber boards. Slightly set-back for straight-line confidence and extra float in powder, the Fate's directional twin shape lends itself to riding everything on the mountain, all without sacrificing its ability to ride and land switch in the park. Ultimately, this makes the board well-suited for intermediate-to-expert riders looking to hone their skills from open bowls to park kickers and jibs. Equipped with a PowerLite core, the Fate features ultra-lightweight poplar wood for loads of pop and unmatched strength when you're thrashing this board from peak to park. Its Reflex core profile thins out the board between the bindings to help you transition from edge to edge easier without extra torsional stiffness hindering your turn initiation. Bi-Lite laminates guarantee buttery-smooth flex for quick turns when you're banking between tight wood runs, carving up groomers, and navigating crowded slopes. Plus, the Sintered Speed Formula HD base easily reaches maximum velocity when you're launching bigger kickers and racing your friends down the mountain.",

Trutwin-Identical nose and tail shape and lengths, combined with an equally designed woodcore profile, allows for a balanced ride whether ridden regular or switch. Freestyle your way through any park, pipe or all over the mountain. Biaxial-A smooth, easy, torsional feel, the majority of the fibers are in the 0 axis to add extra pop and an easy torsional flex to the board. Easy carving for all-mountain or park performance. Truflex-Similar to the ReFlex core, TruFlex core technology features a high strength-to-weight wood construction utilizing different density poplar woods uniquely profiled to give you excellent all-around response when riding the mountain. EZDT Sidecut-Designed for EZ-Rock and another version of EZ FlatRock, the EZDT is mellow between the bindings and at the tips with a more aggressive grip in the binding areas. This creates a more forgiving ride when things get a bit bumpy and a tight radius blended for quick carves. Optix 2000-A high-density, extruded base that is extremely easy to maintain and fix. The Optix 2000 is one of the highest wax absorbing bases on the market and will give you all the speed you need even if you don\u2019t wax on a regular basis.",

Freestyle your way through any park, pipe or all over the mountain. Biaxial-A smooth, easy, torsional feel, the majority of the fibers are in the 0 axis to add extra pop and an easy torsional flex to the board. Easy carving for all-mountain or park performance. Truflex-Similar to the ReFlex core, TruFlex core technology features a high strength-to-weight wood construction utilizing different density poplar woods uniquely profiled to give you excellent all-around response when riding the mountain. EZDT Sidecut-Designed for EZ-Rock and another version of EZ FlatRock, the EZDT is mellow between the bindings and at the tips with a more aggressive grip in the binding areas. This creates a more forgiving ride when things get a bit bumpy and a tight radius blended for quick carves. Optix 2000-A high-density, extruded base that is extremely easy to maintain and fix. The Optix 2000 is one of the highest wax absorbing bases on the market and will give you all the speed you need even if you don\u2019t wax on a regular basis.",

This board was designed for park rats who love jibs and jumps, but are also ready to start riding outside the gates and hucking tricks into powder. Nitro's Cam-Out profile features a mellow version of camber with early transitions to provide the pop and edge hold of camber, but with a more forgiving feel and smoother turn initiation. The Urban flex is soft for easy pressing and buttering, as well as surfy pow turns but won't wash out on you when you're hitting jumps. Biax fiberglass provides a buttery flex for getting loose on jibs and making smooth turns, and beefy RailKiller edges are 20% thicker than standard edges so they can take a beating when you're throwing down in the streets. The lightweight Powercore II poplar core features inlaid beech strips for extra strength, and it has Whiplash profiling so it's thinner between the bindings for maximum pressibility and thicker underfoot for durability. The extruded base is easy to repair when you ding it up on gritty streets or hidden stumps beneath the snow.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "New for this season, the Rome Buckshot Snowboard is the brainchild of freestyle wizards Toni Kerkela and Ozzy Henning. Built to handle their explosive riding styles, this board was built to grease rails in the streets, link lines in the park, and catch air off any and all takeoffs it comes across.When designing this board, Toni and Ozzy demanded pop, pop, and more pop. So Rome obliged by giving the Buckshot a classic camber profile to help you load up ollies and boost off lips. Then, Rome added a bamboo rod milled into the core for an extra-snappy feel. Toni and Ozzy have also been known to gap to a seriously huge rail or two in their time, so Rome threw in Basalt Impact Plates to reduce board breakage next to the bindings. Impact edges are beefier so they can stand up to repeated rail hits, and the SinterTrue base keeps you moving fast when you need speed to keep your line going.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Camp Seven Drifter Snowboard : The Drifter has been upgraded and refined to perfection! An all new hybrid design, the Drifter features the new CRCX camber profile. The CRCX is a rocker dominate \"camber-rocker-camber\" profile which greatly increases float in powder and elevates your contact points to ensure you never catch an edge. The small cambered sections in the nose and tail only engage when you tell them to, and create explosive pop for ollies and jumps. Then we took our lightest core, the Dual Density Poplar DD2, and added our atrisan grade heartwood stringers to the rail for our Bash X finish. This creates the strongest construction possible and helps drive your edge in to snow and ice with ease. A twin design makes this board at home riding regular or switch. Add in biax over triax fiberglass construction and you get insane durability, and the smoothest flex pattern imaginable. Profile: Camber Rocker Camber CRCX: An all new design, this is a rocker dominant \"camber-rocker-camber\" profile. Overall rocker creates tons of float in powder and prevents edge catches for a super smooth ride. Small sections of camber in the tip and tail add explosive pop and increases the effective edge making high speed turns a breeze. Construction: DD2 with Bash X Our most popular and lightest weight dual density DD2 Core with maximum edge hold and durability! Starting with hand selected Poplar that runs tip to tail, there\u2019s no particle board, presswood, wafers, or other inferior products that you find in many of the other boards on the market. We then add artisan grade heartwood stringers down each edge of the board. Designed to take a beating from even the most intense riders, the added rail strength also drives your edges harder and deeper in to even the iciest snow! If you\u2019re looking for edge hold and control over the entire mountain, this is the core for you!",

        "DESCRIPTION": "For the backcountry enthusiast that likes to swallow snow by the mouthful, the Rossignol XV Sushi LG Splitboard is a Xavier De Le Rue-designed pow-slayer that pays homage to Japan's legendary powder renaissance of the 1990s. The first thing you're likely to notice about the Sushi is its pow-friendly swallowtail design that keeps your weight distributed in the rear of the board, keeping the super-fat nose floating to the surface in all but the deepest conditions. But we all know that to get to the goods, sometimes you need to go through the bads, so the folks at Rossignol generously designed the sushi to include camber underfoot for stability, and rocker in the tip, to keep the nose on top of the deep. The lack of a pronounced tail can make stomping flat, harder landing an intimidating prospect, but if you treat the Sushi strictly as a pow stick for light, fluffy snow, you're unlikely to experience a better, more effortless ride.",

The Dreamcatcher features a CRCX rocker dominate camber profile which allows for easy catch free riding and superior float on those dreamed of powder days. Paired with the Siren bindings, this package is all about making progression easier. Whether it's groomers, powder, or park, this package will have you riding better than you could have ever dreamed. Camp Seven Dreamcatcher Snowboard : After combining a laundry list of dream features for a board we decided why pick and choose? We put them all into one board, the Dreamcatcher. The all new CRCX profile provides the best of every camber story. A rocker dominate profile with mild camber in the tip and tail eliminates all edge catches while still providing maximum edge hold in the iciest conditions. Biax over biax laminates allow the board to easily flex and pop without sacrificing durabiltity. A dual density Poplar core completely surrounded by rubber dampening add strength to the board while reducing chatter. Profile: CRCX Full rocker in the center to free up your contact points for catch free riding and serious float in powder, is then paired with mild camber in the tip and tail for explosive pop and tons of added control. Construction: DD2 Core The new DD2 core is the lightest core in our line. Featuring hand selected Poplar that runs tip to tail, there\u2019s no particle board, presswood, wafers, or other inferior products that you find in many of the other boards on the market. We then add high density wood stringers that run through the middle of the board to add increased response and explosive pop. A true all mountain core! Siren Mystic Snowboard Bindings: Designed specifically for the lady riders, the Siren Mystic is the perfect example of a female specific binding. Focusing on comfort, ease of use, and progression, the Mystic will make riding easier than ever before!",

        "DESCRIPTION": "The Rome Agent Snowboard is a legendary freestyle workhorse that's dependable for day-in, day-out abuse, regardless if you're sending park hits, perfecting your jib skills, or dropping wind-lips above treeline. Ideal for the experienced freestyle rider, the Agent features traditional camber, which amplifies pop and control when you're snapping off every hit in sight and railing precise turns on a dime. Its smooth, mid-level flex and directional twin shape lend freestyle versatility across the entire mountain. Ultimately, the Agent is a great choice for the rider seeking one board for nearly any condition or terrain you'll encounter over the season. Creating a lightweight, lively feel, the SuperPop Core Matrix combines long popular wood segments with three densities of ultra-light wood. Carbon Single Barrel Hotrods are milled directly into the board's nose and tail, anchored only at the ends near the insert packs. This allows them to flex dynamically like a spring board for amplified snap. Z-Tech 1. 0 places a one-inch strip of Zylon down the board's centerline. Zylon is a lightweight material that's stronger than carbon, enhancing response without reducing playfulness. Another impressive feature, Impact Edges feature thicker steel to stand up to serious thrashings.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "When untracked snow is the priority, split boards are the simplest solution to getting buried in deep face shots. In designing our Whiteroom, we had two goals. One was to create a board that floats and surfs effortlessly. The other was to create a board that had power in the tail for slashing with a lot of force. To achieve both we armed our Powder-S rocker/positive hybrid camber with two TurboRods of carbon in the tail. Float into a line and explode pillows of snow.",

The I/O offers easily interchanged lenses and comes with two performance mirror lenses included to match conditions on the hill. The spherical lens combines with Vaporator technology to offer an amazing field of view, impressive comfort, and fog-free optics. The medium-fit goggle is helmet compatible with an easy to adjust silicone backed strap for custom comfort. Quick Release Lens System QuickFit Strap Adjustment System with Clip Buckle KEY FEATURES:  Medium Fit Patented Vaporator Lens Technology with Porex Filter Spherical, Carbonic-X Lens with TLT Optics Spherical Lens increases interior volume for fog-free vision 5X Anti-Fog Inner Lens Includes Two Performance Mirror Lenses Quick Release Lens System 3-Layer, DriWix Face Foam Ultra-Wide, Silicone Backed Strap QuickFit Strap Adjustment System with Clip Buckle Helmet Compatible Includes Microfiber Goggle Bag with Replacement Lens Sleeve Lifetime Warranty  VAPORATOR LENS TECHNOLOGY WITH POREX FILTERPatented Vaporator lens technology utilizes processes previously reserved for aerospace and medical capacities. These lenses are robotically cut and bonded together with an airtight silicone bead to eliminate lens delamination--the number one cause of between-the-lens fogging.A micro-porous filter called Porex completes the system. Its composition is structured such that air molecules may pass through the filter while water molecules cannot. By utilizing this filter, the thermal lens is allowed to adjust to varying altitudes while preventing moisture from entering the space between the lenses creating an amazingly strong thermal lens barrier. CARBONIC X LENS Carbonic-X outer lenses are individually molded to offer optimum scratch and impact resistance, increased visual acuity, and enhanced contrast sensitivity. The inner lens is impregnated with Fog-X lens treatment for increased anti-fog performance. The Carbonic-X lens meets Class 1 optical standards as well as ANSI Z87.1 standards. With SMITH TLT Distortion-free rays straight to your eyeWithout SMITH TLT Refracted rays to your eyeTAPERED LENS TECHNOLOGY (TLT)When light passes through a medium--such as a lens it refracts, i.e. changes course. If left uncorrected, this refraction can cause visual distortion and eye fatigue. Smith\u2019s TLT straightens out the incoming light rays by progressively tapering the lens from the optical center toward the peripheral view. What this means for you is that you see with accuracy and increased comfort.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Don't settle for the tunnel vision of ordinary goggles. When we engineered Canopy, we expanded the lens volume and created a low-profile frame design. That means you'll enjoy a wide-open view with maximized peripheral and downward vision. The razor-sharp optics take advantage of Platonize lens material that filters out 100% of all UV and with the combination of dual vented lens architecture and F3 anti-fog coating, you'll have superior protection against the threat of fog-ups. Our O-Flow Arch technology makes the simple act of breathing a lot easier. For even more comfort, the face foam is a triple layer with moisture-wicking fleece and the O Matter chassis stays flexible in bone-chilling weather while the strap anchor plates distribute pressure evenly. The wide, adjustable strap has silicone lining to stay securely in place. Canopy is designed for improved compatibility with helmets and most prescription eyewear frames. As far as protection goes, this Oakley goggle meets the impact resistance standards of ANSI Z87.1 and EN 174:2001.",

TNT Technology is an amazing weight reduction construction that brings together the TubeLite Woodcore, Vapor Tip, and advanced composites that feel very strong and stable. The TubeLite Woodcore uses wood with hollowed out channels of 5mm diameter carbon that run through the arc of the sidecut for a stable feeling at ultra-high speeds, which are very responsive. The Vapor Tip uses inserts of Advanced Composites in the tip and tail of the Ripstick that absorb vibrations and increase maneuverability. Elan's SST Sidewalls will transmit your energy directly to the edges of the ski for uncompromised edge hold and the feeling that you will be carving on railroad tracks. If you want a ski that will feel very stable, highly versatile, and incredibly light on your feet, rip it, with the Elan Ripstick 106!

        "DESCRIPTION": "The Idea Up G from Roces is a great way for your daughter to have a single ski boot for a few seasons. A Free Flexing Tongue gives the Up a soft and easy flex that will allow her to bend and move the boot to learn proper technique. The single buckle Up fits sizes 16, 17, and 18.5, and the double buckle Up fits sizes 19, 20, 21, and 22. A dial located on the outside heel of the boot expands the heel pocket with each turn of the dial without changing the length of the boot sole, so bindings never need to be re-mounted. A certified technician should adjust the bindings each season for their weight though. If you want a ski boot that looks great and will fit properly for multiple seasons, the Roces Up G is a fantastic choice.

The positioning of the attachments allows the Lil Ripper Gripper to change from a kids ski training harness to a kids snowboard training harness in seconds. Finally, a kids training harness that all Lil&apos; Rippers can use! The leashes are 4m (12 ft) long and retract when not in use. The leashes can be locked at any length up to 4m. When retracted, the leash handles are securely stored in the holsters on the sides of the harness - for additional safety when riding the lifts. A safety handle has also been sewn to the back of the harness to help keep a grip on those Lil&apos; Rippers while riding the chairlift - or helping them up from a faceplant! Every Lil&apos; Ripper Gripper purchase includes a Lil&apos; Tip Gripper ski tip connector - to help make those perfect snowplows!",

The Inter Pivot heel is easy to step into, so you won't get left behind on a powder day, and the stainless steel gliding AFD place resists grime, ice, and snow to deliver a smooth and reliable feel every time you step into this all-mountain binding.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "From the hard single-pitch splitters of Indian Creek to the soaring alpine walls of the Charakusa Valley, the Black Diamond Chaos harness is a highly durable, premium trad climbing harness that's built for long routes and serious abuse. Equally suited to cragging sessions and multi-pitch free climbs, the Chaos features Kinetic Core Construction, which uses a thin layer of Vectran fibers in place of traditional webbing to evenly distribute weight across the waist and legs. Four pressure-molded gear loops hold cams, slings and on-route essentials, and the front two loops are oversized for optimized racking. A Forged Speed Adjust buckle makes for easy on and off, while the rear 12 kN-rated haul loop secures your tag line.Kinetic Core ConstructionEmploying a tri-laminate of Vectran polymer, Kinetic Core Construction is not the next step in harness design - it's a quantum leap forward. Almost all harnesses use one or two strands of narrow structural webbing, resulting in thin lines of tension that require thick foam padding to alleviate pressure points. Kinetic Core Construction eliminates this requirement by distributing the load evenly throughout the harness's entire structure, a design idea not far in principle from our original Alpine Bod harness. The result is the Ozone, Aura, Chaos, and Xenos: harnesses that are dramatically sleeker, lighter and more comfortable than any other harness ever made.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "There's no point in beating around the bush: the Tecnica Mach1 130 LV Men's Ski Boot is a hard-charging, take-no-prisoners, race-bred freeride boot that's not particularly interested in slowing down, taking it easy, or just cruising. In addition to a burly 130 flex, well-defined heel pockets, taller cuffs, and pre-punched navicular areas, the Mach1 boasts the same 98mm last and easy on/off Quick-Instep Max overlap construction featured on Tecnica's World-Cup-conquering Inferno boots. This construction is key, since it makes the Mach1 perfect for lower-volume feet (hence the LV) or even more precise for skiers who are looking for the ultimate performance fit. The sculpted polyether shell provides a snugly confident fit around the foot, while the stiff polyester cuff gives the power to conquer big lines and big drops at high speed without worrying about feeling loose, soft, or wobbly in your boots. Tecnica designed the Custom Adaptive Shape (C. A. S.) UltraFit Pro Race liner to exactly match the contours of the shell, giving you a seriously precise and powerful out-of-the-box fit that won't pack out after half a season like traditional liners tend to do. The LV uses a thinner and more responsive liner than the classic Mach1 for more sensitivity and less chance that it will pack out and get sloppy. The C. A. S. liner is also designed to be heat molded for a fine-tuned fit, giving you the ability to rip in comfort from the first chair to the last run. A fat 45mm power strap lets you cinch everything down for snug and powerful feel, and the Mach1's subtle canting and flex adjustments give you the ability to dial your stance. When the TechniGrip soles wear out, you can replace them for more grip and surer binding release and retention, or you can swap them out for a full-length pre-canted sole to address any alignment problems you're having. If you like to push your skiing and need a boot that can keep up, the Mach1 130 LV is a pretty damn good bet.",

This versatile binding is a thing of beauty that offers powerful and smooth energy transmission from your boot to your ski, no matter what kind of terrain you take it down. A Triple Pivot Light toe keeps the weight down but holds on with tenacity, just like the beefier Marker models in the Royal Family. The Squire's gliding AFD (anti-friction device) allows for safety and precision that is unhindered by dirt, snow, and ice buildup, while the Hollow Linkage Reel two-piece TwinCam heel allows for smooth, easy entry, even in snowy conditions. With a mid-range DIN of 3 to 11, the Squire is the crowd pleaser of the Royal Family.",

It includes Memory Fit for the personalization of a custom ski boot in minutes, plus a Memory Fit 3D Platinum liner with pre-shaped heel and ankle areas for an even better first fit. The reason it\u2019s so light is a Grilamid cuff combined with our radical new Progressive Shell that adds reinforcement in key zones but reduces wall thickness overall to cut weight by 25%. For the best combination of snow-feel and power ever felt in an all-mountain boot, Hawx Ultra also features an asymmetric Energy Backbone that provides extra strength and edge grip for super strong skiing. Add Power Shift, Cuff Alignment and our new Cantable Grip Pads and you\u2019ve got one of the best performing, most customizable boots to date.",

These wider ski boards allow more aggressive carving and due to the construction, most often with wood cores, provide more energy and stability at speed. They may take a little getting used to, as you have to lean them over on edge more than the narrower ones. This often doesn't take longer than a day at most to get the feel of them. Wider ski boards are usually relatively more expensive because of the construction.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "The Soul 7 HD from Rossignol is back and better than ever! How did Rossignol improve upon an already super popular, high performing freeride all mountain ski? With a whole new tip concept and shape that really changes the feel of the ski. The Soul 7 HD has always been famous for its maneuverability and relative ease of use. It has become a go-to ski for trees, moguls, and really any kind of off-piste terrain, but also retains solid performance on groomed slopes. It\u2019s an all mountain ski geared toward the more freeride-oriented, playful skier. For 2018 Rossignol is introducing their Air Tip 2.0. This new tip is both lighter and stronger thanks to the fact that it extends further into the core of the ski and also uses brand new, symmetrical reinforcements that run all the way to the tip. The result is a ski that is just as maneuverable as it\u2019s always been, but is now significantly more stable, quieter at speed, and overall smoother. Anyone that\u2019s been a fan of the Soul 7 in past seasons will still absolutely love it, but the changes to the new ski do make it hold up to more aggressive skiing much better than the previous skis, so the Soul 7 HD may find its way into some new ski quivers.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Plenty of people will have you believe that you need a different ski every time conditions are different, but they've never been on the Volkl RTM 84 UVO Ski. It's an all-mountain ski for experts who don't want their gear to hold them back, but it's not built with a take-no-prisoners attitude; its surprising versatility comes courtesy of the 3D.Ridge construction, which concentrates the mass of the ski in the center, so the ski feels light, agile, and incredibly quick from edge to edge while maintaining the stiffness of a traditional frontside ripper. Volkl also laid down a metal laminate to give the RTM plenty of power to bust through chop and chunder, and mounted the tip with a UVO vibration dampening mechanism, which actually pendulums back and forth to counteract vibration and give you a buttery smooth ride. There won't be any fussing around once you get your boards, either, because Volkl ships them mounted with an iPT Wide Ride XL 12.0 binding, a bomber clamp that be cranked all the way up to 12 for solid retention and reliable release.",

The Low Contour Geometry Cuff creates a wide range of motion and the drive to get their skis around the gates and quickly and efficiently as possible. Dalbello's Bi-Injected PU Shell delivers a high amount of energy right to their skis, and four Micro Adjustable Buckles get the fit dialed in easily.

        "DESCRIPTION": "The Nomad Blackeye Ti from Atomic is a very smooth skiing ski for the strong intermediate to expert skier. This season Atomic has added its new Carbon Tank Mesh Construction that provides extra stability. Carbon Tank Mesh uses a woven layer of rigid mesh that increases the torsional strength for better edge hold, and power when you really start cranking some turns. The 81mm waist is easy to carve, and can withstand cruddy or variable snow. The Atomic ARC Technology attaches the binding platform to the ski with a single anchor point for a smooth and natural flex, with consistent edge contact. The Power Wood Core uses Ash and Poplar to keep the ski light and snappy, with layers of Titanium above and below the wood core give you extra horsepower, and stability. Atomic's Step Down Sidewall 2.0 Construction uses a vertical sidewall under the binding platform for increased edge hold, and a cap construction on the tips and tails for better maneuverability. The Blackeye Ti uses All Mountain Rocker to ease turn initiation by having rocker in the tip, and camber on the rest of the ski will give you rebound. The Atomic Blackeye will be a perfect ski for you if you love flying down the groomers with smoothness in each turn.

Made with a Natural Stance the entire RX line stands more upright, with a four degree ramp angle that causes less fatigue, and gives you more control over modern fat, rockered skis. The 40mm Power Strap is fully armed with a Camlock Buckle that will give you a tight wrap across your shin, provide you with more leverage, and a very high amount of rebound with every turn. Lange's Ultra Grip Soles give you a strong amount of traction for hiking, and shock absorbing ability for when you really start cooking down the mountain. The RX 130 has a Control Fit Liner that has a seamless toe box, anatomically correct padding for additional comfort in the toes, and support to prevent heel slippage. An Instep Pocket promotes a high amount of circulation for better blood flow and warmer toes. Lange's Polyether Shell is mono-injected that will allow a skilled bootfitter to easily shape the shell just in case you need a little extra space.

        "DESCRIPTION": "Product Description\nThe new Giro Section combines the look of a traditional skate-style helmet with the light weight of in-mold technology for urban commuting, dirt jumping, and trail-riding.\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAmazon.com\nThe skate-style Giro Section multi-sport helmet is a great choice for a wide range of activities, from urband commuting to mountain biking to dirt jumping. Its low-profile shape is distinct yet minimal, and because the shell and EPS liner are integrated though the in-mold construction process, it's nicely lightweight.   The front of the helmet has also been optimized with Giro's Super Fit technology to work great with our sunglasses and goggles. And with a wide range of graphics, there's a Section to suit any taste or preference.   In-Mold Construction In-mold construction fuses a tough polycarbonate outer shell with the helmet's impact-absorbing foam liner. The fusion process allows Giro to sculpt better ventilation systems, so in-mold helmets can be lighter and cooler than traditional helmets. Wind Tunnel Ventilation Giro helmets are developed utilizing its proprietary Wind Tunnel ventilation system, which combines active vents with internal exhaust channels that thrust cool, fresh air over and around the riders head-while forcing heat and stale air out. This significant increase in air channeling makes a difference that riders will immediately feel and appreciate. Super Fit Engineering A great helmet is so comfortable that once it's on, it virtually disappears. Our proprietary three-size Super Fit system is based on \"human scale factors\" data and over 20 years of crafting helmets for the best bike riders in the world. The result is pure Skull Hugging Luxury, a helmet that fits 98 percent of the world's population, yet looks (and fits) like it was custom made just for you.  Specifications: Suggested use: Urban/Commute, Dirt Jump, All-Mountain Features: Low-profile fit, light weight, Wind Tunnel Ventilation Construction: In-mold EPS liner, polycarbonate shell Ventilation: 8 vents",

        "DESCRIPTION": "The POC Fornix Helmet provides ultimate protection in a lightweight and well-ventilated construction. POC has used the Aramid bridge concept, initially developed for the ground breaking Trabec trail helmet and optimized it for the Fornix structure. By applying Aramid in strings and molding them together with the foam liner, the helmet is kept lightweight but at the same time offers increased stability and protection and provides better energy absorption. The ventilation system is built on 6 vents at the top using a sliding plate for easy opening/ closing, as well as front and rear vents in order to allow air to easily flow through the construction. The front of the helmet is designed not only to seamlessly integrate with your goggles, but also to prevent your goggles from fogging. Vertical vents that channel the air downwards achieve this. The Fornix helmet is equipped with a turn-ring size adjustment system so you can dial it in to achieve that perfect fit.",

By applying Aramid strings and molding them together with the foam liner, it was possible to develop a lightweight helmet while maintaining structural stability and a high level of protection. The tensile strength of the aramid fiber is very high and when bonded to the helmet structure, it allows energy to be dispersed over the entire bridge, giving the helmet better energy absorption. Fornix is generously ventilated and the size adjustment system makes it possible to customize the fit of the helmet to ensure it stays safe and comfortable in place.",

By applying Aramid strings and molding them together with the foam liner, it was possible to develop a lightweight helmet while maintaining structural stability and a high level of protection. The tensile strength of the aramid fiber is very high and when bonded to the helmet structure, it allows energy to be dispersed over the entire bridge, giving the helmet better energy absorption. Fornix is generously ventilated and the size adjustment system makes it possible to customize the fit of the helmet to ensure it stays safe and comfortable in place.",

The innovative, all-weather Holt helmet, from active sports gear maker Smith Optics, can be customized with the included convertible pad kit to keep your lid warm on the winter slopes, and cool in the summer skate park.  Temperature and moisture management, in both helmet and goggles, is the single most important factor in enjoying a day of riding, and Smith Optic's Dual Regulator ventilation system independently controls both front and rear sections of venting. By exhausting heat through the rear vents while maintaining a sealed front end, your body is able to effectively cool down when needed, but avoid the dreaded \"ice cream headache\" caused by cold air blasting against your forehead. Additionally, Smith's AirEvac system generates maximum airflow and removes warm, fog-causing air via air channels built into the helmet, keeping your head dry and your goggles clear. The system is especially effective when pairing a Smith helmet with Smith goggles.  Smith's renowned, impact resistant Bombshell Construction utilizes an injection molded ABS shell to ensure superior durability against dents and dings while, of course maximizing head protection. An optional Skullcandy Audio System (sold separately) completely integrates into the helmet's padding, letting you listen to your favorite playlist while riding the rails or half pipe walls.     Smith helmets and goggles are designed to work together to remove warm, moist air and prevent fogging.

        "DESCRIPTION": "As its name suggests, the DSP Sport is a trimmed-down version of the DSP Pro, with a super-simple one-button interface that gives you only three options\u2014send, search, and flag. Just slide the side switch to toggle between transmitting and receiving, and mark burials using the flag button. When you've flagged a signal, the three antennas automatically switch to the nearest unflagged signal for streamlined searching. The Sport has a 50m circular search range and a smart transmitter that, during a burial, automatically switches to the antenna with the clearest broadcasting range, minimizing dead spots and signal traps that can drastically reduce a beacon's effectiveness. A simple, clear display makes the Sport easy to learn and even easier to use. It has a distance readout, a directional arrow, multiple-burial indicators, and a battery-life display, which provide all the necessary information without cluttering the screen.",
