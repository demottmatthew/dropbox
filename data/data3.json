Trezor brings peace of mind. Ultimate security - no matter how unprotected your computer or internet connection might be, your coins always stay safe with Trezor as it never exposes your private keys. Trezor is an isolated environment for offline transaction signing and using a small display you can visually verify the transaction contents. That's why all operations using Trezor are entirely safe. Easy to use - Trezor is windows, OS X and Linux friendly. All you need to do is to connect your Trezor to the computer and follow the instructions. There are only two buttons, to confirm or to deny the action, so using Trezor is as easy and as intuitive as it can be.

These features are designed to encourage a more natural, relaxed positioning of the arms, hands and wrist, providing greater comfort and helping to avoid injury during extended use. Built for productivity, Microsoft believes in the constant pursuit of excellence, and is always looking for ways to improve the comfort and productivity of our hardware. The new split spacebar with backspace functionality on the Sculpt Comfort Keyboard is the perfect example. Research shows that 90 percent of people use only their right thumb to hit the space bar, and that the backspace key is one of the most frequently used keys on a keyboard. Knowing this, Microsoft Hardware designers built a larger, split spacebar that includes a backspace bar on the left-hand side. The new design helps improve typing speed and provide improved comfort.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "There are many factors to consider when upgrading from 3.5\" hard-drive (HDD) to 2.5\" solid-state drive (SSD). One of those is that direct mounting of SSDs in most desktop computer cases is not possible due to lack of dedicated 2.5\" drive bays. Corsair Dual SSD Mounting Bracket is a perfect solution to this problem. It is an adapter specially designed to securely mount up to two 2.5\" SSDs into existing standard 3.5\" hard-drive bay. It fits any desktop computer case with at least one standard 3.5\u201d hard-drive bay available. The installation is straight-forward, which makes for the hassle-free transition to SSD.

To support the higher capacity needs, SD cards are now requiring a different design. The new SD 2.0 specifications - which supports 4GB and up - is called Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC). The SD Association has created and defined 3 speed classes to help you identify speed and performance capabilities/minimum requirements of SDHC cards and their SDHC host products. Cards address data (read and write) at numerous speeds. Many factors impede this performance. SDHC guarantees a minimum read and write speed necessary to handle recording high quality video and audio. The maximum card speed may vary, but you can always depend on SDHC cards to meet your SDHC host product's high quality performance requirements. Because SDHC works differently (supports the new higher capacity cards) this new card format is not backwards compatible with legacy SD format host devices.",

In other words, the entire process is centrally controlled and it makes the quality control simple and well-organized; and helps to maintain the quality of all genuine Canon inks at a high level. All genuine Canon ink cartridges are designed for your easy printing of your beautiful prints.     Long-Lasting Beautiful Photos In order to provide longer-lasting and more beautiful vivid photo prints, Canon continues to develop genuine dye inks and genuine Canon photo papers specifically for PIXMA printers and take advantage of the superb printing ability of the \"FINE\" print head. ChromaLife100+ is a system to help preserve both long lasting beauty and durability of photos with the combination of genuine Canon dye inks and photo papers.     Print Crisp Text When printing text or a document, pigment black ink takes a prominent role to help deliver crisp and sharp text and characters on plain paper. New genuine Canon pigment black ink brings dense and crisp-and-sharp black text print to the output because the surface of the pigment in the ink has been chemically treated on the nanoscale using Canon original treatment methods and treating agent. These nanoscale technologies suppress unwanted light reflection to the print surface by settling pigment particles on the paper surface to effectively control the reflection, and results in delivering denser black print.      Automatic Ink Monitoring Genuine Canon ink tank equips LED to tell the user that ink level is now low and soon to be depleted, so that the user can prepare the replacement in advance. If the user does not replace the empty ink tank and keeps on printing, the print quality may deteriorate and fail to meet the standard for set printing conditions. LED flashes to inform users of which ink tank needs to be replaced. This helps to prevent users from incorrectly replacing ink tanks which contains enough ink to print.     CREATIVE PARK PREMIUM - Make Printing Fun CREATIVE PARK PREMIUM is a premium content service available exclusively to owners of select Canon PIXMA printers only when all of the software and the colors of genuine Canon inks are installed.

With the use of high quality cloth material, an optimized texture which guarantees both smoothness and glide and a specially designed non-slippery rubber base this pad blows away the competition and is a great choice not only for the hardcore gamer but also for graphic designers and others who use their mouse for extended periods of time.

Logitech\u2019s ConferenceCam BCC950 is the first all-in-one video and audio conferencing device designed with small groups in mind. It combines a freestanding wide-view HD webcam with an enterprise-quality speakerphone in one easy-to-use, computer-connected device.

        "DESCRIPTION": "The SDHC memory card is a highly secure stamp-sized flash memory card, which can be used in a variety of digital products: digital music players, cellular phones, handheld PCs, digital cameras, digital video camcorders, smart phones, car navigation systems and electronic books. To support the higher capacity needs, SD cards are now requiring a different design. The new SD 2.0 specifications - which supports 4GB and up - is called Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC). The SD Association has created and defined 3 speed classes to help you identify speed and performance capabilities/minimum requirements of SDHC cards and their SDHC host products. Cards address data (read and write) at numerous speeds. Many factors impede this performance. SDHC guarantees a minimum read and write speed necessary to handle recording high quality video and audio. The maximum card speed may vary, but you can always depend on SDHC cards to meet your SDHC host product's high quality performance requirements. Because SDHC works differently (supports the new higher capacity cards) this new card format is not backwards compatible with legacy SD format host devices.",

AmazonBasics 4.7 GB 16x DVD-R 100-Pack Spindle  Recommended Uses:   Record video and movies for playback on a DVD player Share photos with friends and family Back up and archive up to 4.7 GB of important data  Make sure your system is compatible: Click here to ensure your DVD burner has the proper firmware to handle high-performance DVDs.            Technical Specifications:   Capacity: 4.7 GB Format: DVD-R Recording speed: 16X Recording time: up to 2 hours  Warranty: AmazonBasics 1-Year Limited Warranty [PDF]             This spindle of 100 AmazonBasics 16X DVD-Rs provides a natural storage solution for videos, movies, photos, and important data. Each disc offers a capacity of 4.7 GB. These DVD-Rs support fast write speeds of up to 16X and provide up to two hours of recording time.  Having Writing Errors or Can't Burn the DVDs?  Most writing errors are likely caused by older or out-of-date firmware on DVD burners. For optimum performance, we recommend that you check your DVD burner and update the firmware if needed:  Users with Stand-alone DVD burners  If you have an older DVD burner and want to know if your firmware version is compatible with this product, read our  instructions for determining the version.  Users with Laptop and PC  If your system is less than four years old, you likely have a compatible writer and firmware. (If you cannot write to the blank media, ensure that you have a DVD writer and not a disc reader.) If your system is more than four years old, update your firmware from the PC/Laptop manufacturer's website.    DVD-R: Quality Media Storage DVD-R is a Write-Once format, which means you can read the files many times, but you cannot record over them or edit them. This format is ideal for sharing videos, organizing your media library, or archiving important business or personal data. Made of durable materials, these DVD-Rs provide a permanent lifetime storage for all those files you want to save. DVD-Rs are compatible with most standard DVD readers, which means that after you burn your favorite videos to a DVD-R, you can play them back on most DVD players. With 4.7 GB of space on each disc, you can store up to two hours of standard video.  16X Write Speed: Quick and Convenient AmazonBasics DVD-Rs enable fast write speeds up to 16X (burn speed will fluctuate) for quick, clean data transfer. To take full advantage of these speeds, your DVD burner must burn at speeds of at least 16X. Consult your computer or DVD burner product manual for this information. At 16X, transfer speed translates to 21.60 MB/s, which means that you can burn a full disk in less than four minutes. The organic dye used on the write side of these DVD+Rs provides stable writing at high speeds for reliable, accurate finished disks.  Quality construction minimizes errors and improves performance.  DVD-R vs. DVD+R There are two types of recordable DVD disks available. Almost all recent DVD players and drives can handle both burned DVD-R and DVD+R disks, but some older players can only read one format or the other. It is important to check your player\u2019s manual to determine which DVD type it supports.  Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging This AmazonBasics product features Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging that is recyclable. It comes without excess packaging materials such as hard plastic clamshell casings, plastic bindings, or wire ties. The packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging.

Featuring three protected AC outlets, two protected, powered USB outlets, and a unique rotating plug design that lets you work in tight spaces, this compact surge protector lets you plug in and charge all your essential devices wherever you are.             Mini Surge Protector/Dual USB ChargerAt a Glance:  3 AC outlets and 2 powered USB ports Complete protection on all outlets 360-degree rotating plug with 4 locking positions Includes mini-USB cable for charging phones, MP3 players, and other devices Lifetime Product and $75,000 Connected Equipment Warranties                  You can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on.      Includes mini-USB cable for charging phones, MP3 players, and other devices.    Convenient, Dependable Design for Worry-Free Travel Hotel rooms, airport terminals, and coffee shops never seem to have enough power outlets to handle all your devices at once. With the Belkin Mini Surge Protector you no longer have to choose what to charge first. This surge protector acts as a power strip, letting you plug three AC devices into a single wall outlet. It is rated to handle 918 Joules and provides protection against power surges and spikes, since the smart traveler is looking for protection of essential gear and irreplaceable data, not just extra outlets. Two Powered USB Outlets Let You Charge More Devices Easily In addition to its three AC outlets, this surge protector features two protected, powered USB outlets, so you can easily charge your iPod along with other USB devices. These USB outlets do not transmit data and the surge protector cannot be used as a hub, but they do make it exceptionally easy to keep devices that are charged via USB interfaces up and running without blocking your computer's USB ports or the AC outlets that you need for bigger devices. Plus you may be able to leave long, tangle-friendly cords and clunky item-specific chargers at home, since this mini surge protector comes with a mini-USB cable. This is especially convenient now that many phones, including Blackberries and Motorola RAZR phones, feature USB power connections. Unique, Efficient Design with Rotating Plug for Added Versatility Its compact, lightweight, and efficient design means that you can easily slip this mini surge protector into your laptop bag or carry-on, and because Belkin knows that working on the road often means trying to plug in despite awkward outlet or furniture positioning, a 360-degree rotating plug with four locking positions makes it easy to use this device in tight spaces.

You want the ability to stay  connected to what you care about: to live monitor or record what's  happening, perhaps with the aid of scheduling functions or maybe through  simple but powerful motion trigger and smart alert features. You also  need the recordings to be smooth and clear so that the footage is truly  useful, and so you don't have to struggle to discern the details of a  scene. You want the features you need at the highest quality, without  extras you don't need. In other words, you want full choice over your  recording method (HDD/SD/NVR/Cloud), and you want to spend only for what  fulfills your needs.With the R2, you'll enjoy full HD securely  broadcast with dual-stream and H.264 compression to optimize bandwidth  usage on your network. Intelligent motion alerts provide accurate  realtime monitoring. Sophisticated 8X digital zoom provides a closeup on  small details. WDR + LBR enhance balance and smoothness. Powerful  IR-LEDs provide night vision up to 26ft. Wide 110\u00b0 angle keeps the  action in-frame. Camera includes free APP (iOS/Android) and supports  IEEE 802.11n 2G band WiFi and dual system backup. Versus any IP camera,  WiFI wireless security camera system, or CCTV home security camera  system, the R2 offers a new cornerstone of professional quality + value  in the home monitoring and CCTV industries (note: this is an indoor  camera, but we have outdoor security camera models such as the FI9900P  as well which can be compared with weatherproof competitor models such  as the Arlo Smart Security Camera). With unsurpassed performance value \u2013  including a full 2-year USA Warranty \u2013 you can enjoy peace of mind  about your purchase as well as the things you love.Package  Contents: Foscam R2 | Security Camera Wireless Antenna | Mounting  Bracket | Power Supply / Security Camera Adapter | Quick Install Guide |  Manual | 2-Year USA Warranty",

The Razer Kraken 7.1 V2 uses a secondary microphone to record ambient noise, which is then supressed via a complex algorithm, so only the speaker\u2019s voice can be heard clearly through noisy environments. Does this mean that all noise in the background is cancelled out? Active noise-cancelling seeks to cancel as much noise as possible, but not all noise can be cancelled out. We are continuing to improve the technology to give you the best possible communication capability. Does the Razer Kraken 7.1 V2 work with the PS4? The Razer Kraken 7.1 V2 can be connected to the PS4 through the USB port, and outputs stereo sound.",
