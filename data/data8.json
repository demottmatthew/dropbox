The American flag has long symbolized the strength and spirit of our nation. On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed the Flag Act, stating that the U.S. flag should consist of 13 alternating red and white stripes and 13 white stars in a blue field. In 1818, Congress passed legislation stipulating that the number of stars on the American flag should match the number of states in the Union. There are 13 stripes and 50 stars on the current flag. The words \u201cUSA FOREVER\u201d are printed on the bottom of the stamp. This listing is for 40 stamps (2 double-sided books of 20) of either the 2016 or 2017 version of the stamp (see images for the two varieties).",

The Speak Out game brings friends and family together for laugh-out-loud fun as players try to say different phrases while wearing a mouthpiece that won't let them shut their mouth. In the Speak Out game, players draw from the deck and read the phrase as best as they can, but it's not so easy to do when the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The timer counts down as players try to say phrases such as \"he's my stealthy pet ferret name Garrett\", \"slow down, you careless clown\", or \"pelicans love pollywog falafels.\" The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins. The Speak Out game includes 200 double-sided cards, 10 mouthpieces, and a timer.

The Speak Out game brings friends and family together for laugh-out-loud fun as players try to say different phrases while wearing a mouthpiece that won't let them shut their mouth. In the Speak Out game, players draw from the deck and read the phrase as best as they can, but it's not so easy to do when the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The timer counts down as players try to say phrases such as \"he's my stealthy pet ferret name Garrett\", \"slow down, you careless clown\", or \"pelicans love pollywog falafels.\" The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins. The Speak Out game includes 200 double-sided cards, 5 mouthpieces, and a timer.

An ideal introduction to rocket building, this set contains two rocket kits: the Amazon and the Crossfire ISX. It also comes with a launch pad for easy launching, plus two plastic parachutes that ensure a gentle descent to the ground. Whether you're a new rocketeer or a seasoned veteran of the skies, the Tandem-X is sure to deliver plenty of high-altitude thrills.               1469 Tandem-X Launch Set At a Glance:  Age Requirements: 10 and up; adult supervision needed for children under 12 Assembly Requirements: Estes rocket engines for flight, and 4 AA batteries for launch controller (all sold separately) Warranty: One-year warranty against manufacturer defects                             Learn the basics of crafting model rockets with the 3-foot tall Amazon and 15 inch Crossfire. View larger.               Its launch system includes a stabilizing launch pad and push-button controller. View larger.       Blast Off to Extreme Heights With two rocket kits, the Tandem-X Launch Set offers two unique launching experiences. The aptly-named Amazon is the bigger of the two rockets: it towers at almost three feet tall and features a fearsome tiger-stripe decal. When flown with a standard Estes engine, the Amazon can soar to heights of 600 feet.  The Crossfire is a smaller craft, standing just a little over 15 inches tall. In spite of its size, this little rocket can blast off to seriously impressive altitudes. Thanks to its aerodynamic fins and nose cone, the Crossfire can reach cloud-bursting heights of 1,150 feet. Both rockets are outfitted with colorful, preassembled parachutes, which ensure they can float gently back to Earth for another flight.  An Introduction to Rocket Building The Tandem-X Launch offers just the right amount of challenge for novice rocket builders. The Amazon is an E2X (easy-to-assemble) rocket, and requires no paint or special tools for assembly. It can be built in less than an hour: simply glue the plastic fins to the tube, install the engine, and attach the parachute. Finish the rocket off with a few self-stick decals, and you're ready to launch.  Once builders have mastered the basics, they can move on to the more advanced Skill Level 1 Crossfire. With its plastic nose cone and laser-cut balsa fins, the Crossfire requires a little more finesse. Assembling the rocket can take an entire afternoon, but it's a rewarding and educational process. Builders will learn several beginner-level rocket techniques, such as painting and sanding. Estes has also included an illustrated, step-by-step instruction guide to help keep the assembly fun, smooth, and frustration-free.  Educational Fun In addition to the thrills it provides, the Tandem-X also has significant educational value. The set transforms kids into amateur rocket scientists, encouraging them to think about how the rockets work. Rocket building teaches kids the basics of propulsion, flight, and aerodynamics, and can help foster an early interest in science and engineering. Even failed launches can turn into a learning experience.  Requires an Estes Engine Both rockets require a specialized Estes engine to launch. For the Amazon, Estes recommends a B4-2 engine for your first flight. The rocket is also compatible with other Estes engines, including the B4-4, B6-2, B6-4, C6-3, and C6-5. For the Crossfire, Estes recommends the A8-3 for first flight, and the B4-4, B6-4, C6-5, and C6-7 for more advanced launching.  What's in the Box Estes 1469 Tandem-X Launch Set with Amazon rocket kit, Crossfire ISX rocket kit, two plastic parachutes, launch pad, and push-button launch controller.   \n\n\n            See all Product description",

Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\n\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.",

Easy auto channel search and a large crisp viewing screen make these goggles some of the best screen goggles for immersive FPV flying. These goggles are some of the best out there. While some may give single screen goggles a bad rap, these goggles defeat any shortcomings of traditional screen goggles by using a beveled lens screen, this allows the screen image to be wrapped around to the sides of the goggles allowing you to see more of the picture without having to constantly be scanning different parts of the screen. The easy channel searching button also makes these goggles ideal for an easy FPV setup. The straps and padding also allow for comfortable long flights as well as decreased eye strain because of the beveled screen.

Here's how it works: One of your friends is going to be the single. Every other player uses perk cards to make a hot date that they think would be a great match for that person. You'll get characters like: a brain surgeon that loves to cuddle, an olympic gymnast that loves video games, and a famous musician that owns your favorite sports team But then everyone gets to play a Red Flag onto another player at the table. Now all of these perfect dates will have flaws like: Punches every barista they see, wears a diaper because it\u2019s \"more convenient,\" or collects human skulls, says they\u2019re practically free! Now that all of the dates are horrible, everyone tries to convince the single to go out with their date. That's pretty much it. The game can be as raunchy or tame as your imaginations allow.",

About the Startup   Describe your product in 3 words. Handheld 3D Creation   How did you come up with the idea for this product? In Spring 2012 our 3D printer had almost completed a 14-hour print when it missed a line, leaving an unplanned gap in the print. A small error had ruined hours of work, and we were going to have to start again. Then inspiration hit: \u201cwhat if we just took the head of the printer off and filled in the gap?\u201d A day later the 3Doodler was born. The first 3Doodler was a clumsy-looking, hand-assembled, device; a collection of gears, a heater unit, and the printer-head of our now dismantled 3D printer. The words \u201c3Doodler\u201d were etched onto its side in green and red in felt tip pen. The 3Doodler Create is the third generation of this product, and it just keeps getting better and better!   What makes your product special? The 3Doodler Create is the latest version of the world's best selling 3D Printing Pen. It's a highly versatile tool with an amazing breadth of applications, including fine art, hobby, DIY, decorate & fix-it projects. The versatility of the 3Doodler Create also extends to the huge array of plastics - 65+ colors, in a range of Matte, Glossy, Glow, FLEXY, Metallic, and Sparkle! Unlike any other device on the market, you can also supercharge your Doodling with the 3Doodler Create accessories, which include a JetPack, for portable Doodling, and the Nozzle Set, which allows you to choose from one of six different nozzle shapes and sizes.   What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part has been building a vibrant and creative community! Starting with our first Kickstarter campaign, we have always put community front and centre. Hundreds of thousands of units later, it's thrilling to see what users have been doing with the 3Doodler, and how they have shared with and inspired each other (and us!). Their creations are all over social media sites and on our website, and extend from craft and design, through to innovative hacks and fixes, and into a never ending array of educational uses. With 3Doodler Create, our best pen yet, we hope to see even more amazing uses and creations!",

The Titan 12T 550 motor's cooling fan pulls cool air through the motor to keep temperatures down. A cooler running motor allows faster speeds, longer runtime, and extended motor life. This 550 size motor uses a 3mm output shaft. NOTE: Titan 12T motors are intended for use in single motor and single battery pack applications, up to 8.4 volts. Traxxas does not recommend the use of Titan 12T motors in dual motor vehicles, such as the E-Maxx.  Use Traxxas stock and hop-up replacement parts to get the most out of your Traxxas RTR vehicles. This product is made from high quality materials and designed for long-lasting performance. This is replacement hardware for use on Traxxas vehicles; consult your user's manual for exact parts listings.",

Don't charge the battery directly after use, let it cool down to avoid overheating.3. Don't charge the battery with current input above 1A. Never overcharge.Tips:1.Flying errors may happen after flights, a CALIBRATION and some TRIM WORK will fix the problem.2.Motors may heat up if being misused. Take a 10 min break between flights to cool them down.3.Drone weight is less than 0.5lb, FAA registration is not required.TRAINING:Before Flight:1. Ensure batteries are fully charged, no defects on propellers; Connect the battery to the drone, the LED lights flash quickly then slow down within seconds.2. Make sure the drone is put on a flat surface.3. Paring: Turn on the controller, the indicator flashes slowly. Push the left stick up and down, the indicator and LED lights turn to still simultaneously, then paring is succeeded.4. Calibration: Push both control sticks to the right bottom and hold them on, the LED lights flash and stop within seconds, calibration is done.Operation Practice:1.Switch the speed mode to low speed at the very beginning.2.Get use to the throttle stick slowly until you can understand how it works.3.Get use to the trim buttons until you can adjust the drone to be close to hovering.4.If you can\u2019t tell the front of the drone, try to play under headless mode at first.5.Try one key return : Remember it only works under headless mode, and needs to set the drone\u2019s head in front before entering into headless mode.6.Try 3D Flip: Press the function button and push the right stick to any direction. Make sure the height is enough to perform a flip.",

Its compact size hides a high degree of complexity that makes it one of DJI's most sophisticated flying cameras ever. 24 high-performance computing cores, an all-new transmission system with a 4.3mi (7Km) range, 4 vision sensors, and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal, are at your command with just a push of your thumb or a tap of your finger. Powerful Fly for miles. From your pocket. Inside the Mavic's pocket-sized remote controller is DJI's brand new OcuSync transmission technology, with a range of 4.3mi (7km) and Full HD 1080p video streaming. No bumps and scrapes When you know what's in front of you, you won't bump into it. The same is true of the Mavic. Using FlightAutonomy it can see obstacles as far away as 49ft (15m) in front, so that it can fly at up to 22mph (36kph) while avoiding the things it sees. Absolute Precision FlightAutonomy technology means the Mavic can hover precisely in more environments, and automatically land almost exactly where you took off. Stay flying longer Why fly for 10 or 15 minutes when you can fly for up to 27? With the Mavic you can. Use every single pixel The Mavic is the only drone of its size to carry an integrated high-precision 3-axis mechanical camera stabilization system, giving you crystal clear photos and smooth videos, without losing a single pixel.",

Then why not hit the button on your Meeseeks Box, summon up a Meeseeks (or three or eight) and let them help you out? That's their purpose! They want you to succeed and only get slightly angry if you don't. In this dice game, players draw Request cards. Simple things like \"Make Me a Sandwich\" or \"I Want to be a More Complete Woman.\" Then roll your dice and see if you complete the Request. If not, press the button and summon Mr. Meeseeks to help you out. He wants to help. He hates his existence. As soon as your Request is completed, he can cease to exist and everything will be just grand. Don't disappoint Mr. Meeseeks. He will make you do all sorts of embarrassing and foolish things. That is, if he doesn't simply kill you off. The longer it takes for you to complete your Request, the more Mr. Meeseeks will appear. Soon, they may turn violent. So please, do try your hardest. In the end, the player who scores the required number of Victory Points first wins the game. Score points by completing Requests and doing Dares. Unless you're chicken.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Traxxas Certified iD-Equipped LiPo batteries provide the punch and power to reach maximum speed. They come in a full range of capacities and configurations. Traxxas iD-Equipped LiPo batteries are engineered to fit Traxxas models perfectly and maximize their potential. Only Traxxas gives you more of what you want: simple installation, a great price, and the most speed and run time available.  The patented Traxxas High-Current connector is the standard for efficiency, ease of use, and high-current handling. The balance leads are integrated into the connector eliminating separate balance wires and connectors as well as external balance boards. The Traxxas High-Current Connector allows current to flow freely with virtually zero voltage loss due to resistance. Large, textured surfaces provide good grip and the reverse-polarity protection makes them virtually impossible to plug in backwards. Shrouded wire connections eliminate the need for heat shrink tubing. Beefy, gold-plated copper terminals with large, spring-loaded contact areas ensure a perfect connection every time.  Traxxas iD-Equipped Power Cell LiPo packs use a unique construction that results in a firm, rugged, and compact pack that does not require a hard case. This gives them greater capacity and allows the user to monitor the condition of the battery. Unlike a hard-cased pack, if a Power Cell LiPo \"puffs\" or softens due to damage or abuse, the user can easily see and feel the change in the pack.  Power Cell LiPos are constructed of premium cells with extra-wide discharge tabs to maximize their performance. Power Cell LiPo packs feature low resistance 12-gauge Maxx Cable wire, soldered directly to the LiPo cells to minimize resistance.  Traxxas offers the best battery warranty and exchange program available. For the first year, Traxxas will replace any battery found to be defective at no cost. After one year, any Power Cell LiPo battery can be exchanged for a new equivalent for just 50% of the pack's retail price.",

You don't have to be good at accents and the combinations don't need to make sense. In fact, players are encouraged to improvise and make the phrases their own.

Go Fish Yourself lets you inflict a variety of ridiculous and hilarious challenges on your friends and frienemies. The best part is that it's as easy to learn as traditional Go Fish but actually fun! So good luck poking another player with your huge harpoon while balancing a big 'ol booty on your head and plugging your leaky bunghole!",

Where can I download my free copy of Virtual DJ LE? Accessing and activating your free software is as easy as registering your product on the Numark website. We've put together a walkthrough video which takes you step-by-step through the registration, download, and activation process for your included software. \u00a0 Virtual DJ is only operating in a time-limited demo mode, or is asking me to pay for a license. \u00a0Is there something else\u00a0I need to do? You will not have to pay anything extra to use the included Virtual DJ software. \u00a0A license for Virtual DJ is indeed included with the Party Mix. \u00a0However, if you forget to activate the software after installing, it will run in a time-limited demo mode, or will ask you to buy a license. \u00a0Check out the video below for a walkthough on how to fully authorize your Virtual DJ LE software so you won't experience these limitations: \u00a0 Can I scratch with these platters? Of course!\u00a0In fact, some people prefer scratching with\u00a0smaller jog wheels.\u00a0Since the jog wheels\u00a0are\u00a0smaller, they have less mass and\u00a0can move much more quickly and feel more responsive than larger platters to some people. \u00a0 Are the performance pads velocity sensitive? The performance pads on the Party Mix are not velocity sensitive.\u00a0  Do you have to install any drivers for the Numark Party Mix? Nope!

Serato DJ does NOT allow you to custom map unsupported controllers but NI Traktor and many other DJ softwares do.\u00a0  What are the different modes for the Party Ball lights? When activated, the Party Ball lights on the rear of the Party Mix will illuminate according to the current setting which you can choose by pressing the Party Ball Mode button. Modes:  Virtual DJ color-controlled (the default mode when Party Mix is powered on Virtual DJ beat-controlled Fixed-timing random All on All off  \u00a0 Does the Numark Party Mix have an audio interface?

Yes you can. \u00a0  Connect headphones to the headphone output on the Party Mix controller.\u00a0 \u00a0 Make sure that your Party mix hardware is selected and being used by Virtual DJ.  When launching Virtual DJ LE, be sure to select 'Use Soundcard' to auto-setup the Party Mix Hardware, or select Party Mix in the software under Config > Controllers.. \u00a0 Now, load some music onto one or both decks in Virtual DJ. \u00a0 To send a cue signal from a deck to your headphones, press the\u00a0PFL/Cue\u00a0button to send your\u00a0channel's pre-fader signal to the Cue Channel for\u00a0monitoring.

Then pick a Cranium Card and keep it a secret. Without saying any of the words on the Cranium card, you must get the other players to guess what's on that Cranium card by expressing it in the style of the Action card. For example, can you get your friends to guess \"milk a cow\" while acting like a zombie -- or \"fried chicken\" while drawing with your eyes closed -- in just 60 seconds? Be the first player to collect 7 cards to win! Cranium and all related trademarks of Cranium, Inc.

        "DESCRIPTION": "Disclaimer: People will reveal secrets while playing this game. It will be hilarious.   IBETCHA  is a highly interactive mix of Cards Against Humanity and Never Have I Ever. Guess what your friends have done, hear their stories, then laugh your face off. You\u2019re gonna love IBETCHA, or you suck.    How to play    To start the game, each player draws eight Betcha Cards. The hottest person begins as The Victim. Everyone else puts down a card (face-down) they think The Victim has done. The Victim shuffles all the cards then reads each one aloud and says \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to each card. The group then picks which story they want The Victim to tell. Whoever submitted the chosen card gets to keep the card and receives the number of points on the card. After each round, a new player becomes The Victim, and everyone draws back up to eight Betcha Cards. The first person to reach ten points* wins! *You can also play forever. Sample Betcha Cards Level 1: accidentally liked a picture while FB stalking #Unlike #PowerDown #Breathe were voted most likely to... in high school #die know someone in prison #MissYouGrandma accidentally hit \"reply all\" to a work email #CtrlAltDeleteYourself   Level 2: madly searched for clothes when someone knocked on the door #Cops  been in a police car #Shotgun  done something crazy during Truth or Dare #reproduced #HIMYM forgot to erase your browser history #Chloroform.com  Level 3: (appropriate for an Amazon listing)  sent a sext to the wrong person #SryNotYouDad #SupTho  haven't been laid in over a month #MarchSadness  accidentally seduced someone of the wrong gender #MikeCheck  faked an orgasm # OscarBuzz  made a sex tape... poorly #TightBudget  So, are you ready to laugh until you cry? You\u2019re gonna love IBETCHA, we guarantee it!",

New tactic cards that lead to more fully cinematic combats... Rise of the Empire is an expansion for Star Wars?: Rebellion inspired largely by Rogue One. And just as the movie provided new insight into the Galactic Civil War presented in the original Star Wars trilogy, Rise of the Empire adds new depth and story to your Rebellion game experience. You can send Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor to recover the Death Star plans. You can confuse Imperials with false orders and assaults behind enemy lines. You can command Director Krennic and his finest death troopers. And you can set traps for the Rebel pilots and soldiers, luring them away from their base and into massive battles with more fully cinematic combat and tactics. Even Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, offering his services to the Empire and feeding his prisoners to the Sarlaac. Altogether, Rise of the Empire introduces eight new leaders, thirty-six plastic miniatures, five target markers, two attachment rings, three new dice, and more than one-hundred new cards. You'll find U-wings, TIE Strikers, Nebulon-B frigates, and the Interdictor. You'll gain new ways of subverting your opponent's plans, and you'll discover a whole new chapter in your ongoing Galactic Civil War!",

The Metagame is a fun party game about sharing opinions on the most important debates of our time, like \"which feels more like first love: The Mona Lisa or the Big Mac?\" The Metagame includes culture cards that feature media, art, fashion and entertainment, and opinion cards that prompt lively chatter and lots of laughter.  The Metagame is more than one game\u2014it includes six unique games. Some of the games get you talking. Others are about thinking fast. Some games are strategic and others are just plain silly.  Including 200 culture cards and 100 opinion cards, The Metagame scales from two to 33 players. Play it at a dinner party or a family gathering, at a bar or at school, or anywhere that humans gather.   Some opinions on The Metagame include:  \"It\u2019s a clever idea, it\u2019s a beautiful box, it\u2019s peerlessly modern, and it\u2019s generous to the point that you're practically buying a format for games instead of a game. Oh, and it works. You can't play this game without having funny arguments and interesting discussions.\" - Quintin Smith, SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN \" \"A clever, colorful set of tools that let you pose interesting questions to friends, and debate the relative merit of a weird, wild array of issues.\" - Leigh Alexander, BOINGBOING/OFFWORLD  \"When you deal the Metagame deck, there are some wonderfully esoteric conundrums to be debated with the right mix of people and probably drinks.\" - Allison Meier, HYPERALLERGIC  \"There are six games. Each is different. Each will make you laugh.\" - Bernie DeKoven, MAJOR FUN",

In short, the game is a streamlined, confrontational worker placement game filled with murder and intrigue. In long, you play as competing Mafia families who are vying for economic control of the organized crime networks of New York City, deploying your thugs, your Don, your wife, and your heir on the board to shake down businesses and engage in area-control turf wars. Money, rackets, contracts, and special advantages (such as the union boss) are represented by cards in your hand, and your hand size is limited, with you choosing which extra cards to pay tribute to the Don at the end of each of the five rounds. At the end of the game, though, cash is all that matters, and whoever has the most money wins. The game also features drive-by shootings in which enemy tokens are removed from the board and placed face-down in the river. The Don of that family member must play cards to fish their guys out of the river and return them to duty on the New York battlefield.",

About the Startup   Describe your product in 3 words. Handheld 3D Creation   How did you come up with the idea for this product? In Spring 2012 our 3D printer had almost completed a 14-hour print when it missed a line, leaving an unplanned gap in the print. A small error had ruined hours of work, and we were going to have to start again. Then inspiration hit: \u201cwhat if we just took the head of the printer off and filled in the gap?\u201d A day later the 3Doodler was born. The first 3Doodler was a clumsy-looking, hand-assembled, device; a collection of gears, a heater unit, and the printer-head of our now dismantled 3D printer. The words \u201c3Doodler\u201d were etched onto its side in green and red in felt tip pen. The 3Doodler Create is the third generation of this product, and it just keeps getting better and better!   What makes your product special? The 3Doodler Create is the latest version of the world's best selling 3D Printing Pen. It's a highly versatile tool with an amazing breadth of applications, including fine art, hobby, DIY, decorate & fix-it projects. The versatility of the 3Doodler Create also extends to the huge array of plastics - 65+ colors, in a range of Matte, Glossy, Glow, FLEXY, Metallic, and Sparkle! Unlike any other device on the market, you can also supercharge your Doodling with the 3Doodler Create accessories, which include a JetPack, for portable Doodling, and the Nozzle Set, which allows you to choose from one of six different nozzle shapes and sizes.   What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part has been building a vibrant and creative community! Starting with our first Kickstarter campaign, we have always put community front and centre. Hundreds of thousands of units later, it's thrilling to see what users have been doing with the 3Doodler, and how they have shared with and inspired each other (and us!). Their creations are all over social media sites and on our website, and extend from craft and design, through to innovative hacks and fixes, and into a never ending array of educational uses. With 3Doodler Create, our best pen yet, we hope to see even more amazing uses and creations!",

        "DESCRIPTION": "No foolin' - Unicorn meat is real! Excellent source of sparkles! Rick Bite Unicorns, as we all know, frolic all over the world, pooping rainbows and marshmallows wherever they go. What you don't know is that when unicorns reach the end of their lifespan, they are drawn to County Meath, Ireland. The Sisters at Radiant Farms have dedicated their lives to nursing these elegant creatures through their final days. Taking a cue from the Kobe beef industry, they massage each unicorn's coat with Guinness daily and fatten them on a diet comprised entirely of candy corn. As the unicorn ages, its meat becomes fatty and marbled and the living bone in the horn loses density in a process much like osteoporosis. The horn's outer layer of keratin begins to develop a flavor very similar to candied almonds. Blending the crushed unicorn horn into the meat adds delightful, crispy flavor notes in each bite. We are confident you will find a world of bewilderment in every mouthful of scrumptious unicorn meat. Tasty Magical Beast Diagram Parts Unfortunately, due to restrictions on the importation of mythical processed meatstuff, we are unable to bring you Canned Unicorn Meat in the way the Sisters of Radiant Farms intended. When you open your can, you will find one tiny unicorn which has been appropriately sliced into its main cuts of meat. Simply use your Growth Ray to re-embiggen the unicorn before skinning it and processing its flesh. Or if you're lazy, just bring it to your local Mad Scientist-Butcher. He'll know what to do.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "This 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle by famed master painter Charles Wysocki takes you back to an autumn day in this quaint New England town of years gone by. As you piece together Blackbirds Roost At Mill Creek you will discover the road-side farmers stand with so much to offer including pumpkins, carrots, apples and onions. Horse-drawn wagons are all about offering their goods; from whale oil to lobsters to fresh picked corn. As blackbirds roost in the trees and gather around town, cows, chickens and other animals dot the landscape around Ravens Horne Farms.   For more than 40 years Charles Wysocki enjoyed his love affair with life and Americana, and through his imaginative and colorful artwork, touched the hearts of millions worldwide. \"Chuck\" felt a special kinship with puzzlers who share in the creative process by building his paintings one piece at a time.    Every Buffalo Games jigsaw puzzle is manufactured in the U.S.A. from recycled puzzle board. A precision cutting technique guarantees that every piece will fit soundly with the company's signature Perfect Snap. A bonus puzzle poster is also included so that you have a handy reference of what the completed puzzle should look like while you put yours together.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Quickwits: A Party Game   Here's how it works  1.) Each card contains a category and a symbol on it.  2.) One by one each player draws a card and places it face up on the table. 3.) When two symbols on the table match, the players race to give examples of the category on their opponents card. The first to do so gets to keep that card.  4.) Once a word has been said during the game it can no longer be used again.  5.) The objective is to win more cards than your stupid friends.  There is a very good chance you will be screaming in each others faces. It's okay, that's normal. There are several other types of cards in the deck that help keep the game interesting.

The PowerUp 3.0 Bluetooth, Smart Module transforms ordinary paper planes into motorized machines, controllable directly from your smartphone. It\u2019s also an educational experience \u2014 PowerUp 3.0 meshes origami, physics and incorporates all the components of STEAM, (Science, Tech, Engineering, Art, Math). This unique combination allows for schools and teachers to educate students on the basic principles of flight, aerodynamics, and lift. With 180 feet/ 55 meter range, and 10 minutes of flight time capability, PowerUp 3.0 is the first choice in flight.  \n\nFrom the Manufacturer\n                  Features  Crash-proof design | 10 min. flight on a charge | 180 feet range | FlightAssist TM technology.

Customer Testimonial  \"I don\u2019t mean to be overdramatic, but it really combined my boyhood love of paper airplanes with my boy\u2019s love of planes and smartphones into an awesome experience to be enjoyed over and over again.\"    About the Startup   Describe your product in 3 words. DIY paper drone   Where did you get the inspiration for your product? I got excited about the project in 2007 teaching immigrant kids the principles of aerodynamics. While doing research on advances in micro indoor flight I came up with the idea for a remote-controlled paper airplane. The idea gathered momentum, and by 2011 he incorporated a company to build the device, later in 2013 I integrated the smartphone factor into the product and launched a Kickstarter to fund production. The crowd funding campaign raised over $1.2 M becoming the most funded project ever in flight category.   What differentiates your product from similar products out there? I invented the commercial solution for powered paper airplanes. The PowerUp systems universally connect to almost any paper airplane design allowing customers leverage their know how in folding paper airplanes and adding the gravity defying magic of propelled flight. There aren\u2019t any similar products out there which are not cheap imitations.   Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process. PowerUp 3.0 combines technology and art, it allows the customer to be involved in the creation process of a flying machine just by folding a standard copier paper. Making a sheet of paper fly and controlled for up to 10 minutes is not a simple task, the airplane must be folded and adjusted properly. Educating and explaining the creation process to my customers has been challenging, we have created a support page and FAQ data base including tutorial videos guiding our customers step by step through the creation and flying process. Once they get the hang of it, the opportunities are endless and very addicting.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Product Description\nHog Wild was founded in 1996 and we live by these simple rules:   We sell innovative novelty products typically geared to older kids (over 8) and that cross over to adults. We try to be different and dance to our own beat when developing toys and gifts. We avoid competition whenever possible (no board games, no fashion dolls, no flying disks). We don't do gag gifts but do enjoy humor and farting products (we just don't sell them). We're not the brightest bulbs in the warehouse but we do try and often own up to our stupid mistakes. We like things simple because it's easier for us to understand.   We're located in Porkland, Oregon and ship all our products from this sometimes inconvenient location. We typically take 3 to 5 days to process an order for our retail stores and we like to get paid on time. If you're a credit worthy retailer, we'll offer you terms. If you're an \"end user\" we want you to buy from our website and we value you the most of all. I'm sorry our prices are not dirt cheap but what you find from us, you should not find anywhere else. There are times when we get knocked off but that's life in the toy business.   We're always on the prowl for new ideas and look to outside inventors for help. Most of the really good inventors are very hard to find and they are often bar tenders, school teachers, fireman, and other professions not typically associated with inventing. When we find these people, they typically have really clever, never before seen ideas. They are always smarter than we are and we feel very lucky when they license their product idea to us. Fact: The best products we have always come from outside inventors. If you've got a great idea, we'd love to hear from you. If you work at a professional inventing company with fancy presentations and 1,000s of great ideas, you're probably not a great fit for us.\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFrom the Manufacturer\nThe Aquapod is a futuristic, one piece design plastic bottle launcher made of highly durable ABS plastic. It is just an ordinary bicycle pump, a bottle and water. The Aquapod launches ordinary plastic soda bottles up to 100 feet in the air and is the only launcher available with a built in pressure release valve for everyone's safety.",
