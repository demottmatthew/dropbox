Whether utilizing AV shelves to create an open system or a cabinet to keep your electronics concealed, Semblance integrates technology into the home while providing versatile space for storage and display. The 5474-TR is a pre-configured media system. Features Endlessly Configureable & Customizable Satin-etched Glass Surfaces Sturdy Steel Supports Wire Management Channels Finishes Due to variations in computer monitors, actual finish may appear differently online. Visit your local BDI retailer to view actual finish samples. BDI\u2019s wood finishes feature natural hardwood solids and veneers. Wood is a product of nature and - unlike man-made materials that can be manufactured to strict and consistent specifications - has natural imperfections that are part of its appeal and character. Every piece of wood differs from every other, even when coming from the very same tree. As such, variation in grain, texture and tone should be expected from one panel or piece of furniture to the next. It is this variation that separates natural wood from an engineered product, and variations should be expected as part of the beauty of a real wood finish.

        "DESCRIPTION": "The focal point of any room, Semblance is a beautiful showcase for a complete media system. Whether utilizing AV shelves to create an open system or a cabinet to keep your electronics concealed, Semblance integrates technology into the home while providing versatile space for storage and display. The 5454-GH is a pre-configured media system. Features Endlessly Configureable & Customizable Satin-etched Glass Surfaces Sturdy Steel Supports Wire Management Channels Finishes Due to variations in computer monitors, actual finish may appear differently online. Visit your local BDI retailer to view actual finish samples. BDI\u2019s wood finishes feature natural hardwood solids and veneers. Wood is a product of nature and - unlike man-made materials that can be manufactured to strict and consistent specifications - has natural imperfections that are part of its appeal and character. Every piece of wood differs from every other, even when coming from the very same tree. As such, variation in grain, texture and tone should be expected from one panel or piece of furniture to the next. It is this variation that separates natural wood from an engineered product, and variations should be expected as part of the beauty of a real wood finish.

Whether utilizing AV shelves to create an open system or a cabinet to keep your electronics concealed, Semblance integrates technology into the home while providing versatile space for storage and display. The 5423-TJ is a pre-configured media system. Features Endlessly Configureable & Customizable Satin-etched Glass Surfaces Sturdy Steel Supports Wire Management Channels Finishes Due to variations in computer monitors, actual finish may appear differently online. Visit your local BDI retailer to view actual finish samples. BDI\u2019s wood finishes feature natural hardwood solids and veneers. Wood is a product of nature and - unlike man-made materials that can be manufactured to strict and consistent specifications - has natural imperfections that are part of its appeal and character. Every piece of wood differs from every other, even when coming from the very same tree. As such, variation in grain, texture and tone should be expected from one panel or piece of furniture to the next. It is this variation that separates natural wood from an engineered product, and variations should be expected as part of the beauty of a real wood finish.
