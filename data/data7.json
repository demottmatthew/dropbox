Key Features: One-line, 10-digit display Fraction features One-variable statistics Conversions Basic scientific and trigonometric functions  Ideal For: General math Pre-Algebra Algebra 1 and 2 General science\n\nAmazon.com\nOnce you get to a certain level of math classes, a regular old calculator just isn't good enough anymore--you need a high-functioning calculator that can perform algebraic, trigonometric, and statistical problems in addition to general mathematical tasks. The Texas Instruments TI-30XA scientific calculator can do this for you. It is extremely handy when it comes to figuring tricky fractions. It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions when entered in a traditional numerator/denominator format. This calculator can also do a variety of conversions, from fractions to decimals, degrees to radians to grads, DMS to decimal to degrees, and polar to rectangular. The display screen holds up to 10 digits.For high school or college students tackling advanced math, this is a great tool (and a thoughtful back-to-school gift), and with more professors allowing the use of calculators during classes and exams, it's a necessary one. Easy to use and easy to slip into a backpack, the TI-30XA will soon become indispensable for both the serious and the striving math student. --Dana Van Nest",

When the impressions begins to fade, simply slide the pad out, flip it over, and reinsert to instantly double the life. This stamp can be personalized with up to 3 lines of custom information and is ideal as an address stamp or bank deposit stamp.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Color:Stainless Steel/Black\n\n\nProduct Description\nDon't just mask smelly garbage odors with fragrances and messy baking soda; eliminate them. The upgraded DZT13 is now equipped with a Carbon Filter Gate (CFG) that uses activated carbon to effectively eliminate and neutralize the toughest odors.  Smelly and oversized garbage doesn't stand a chance with the upgraded 13 gallon Touchless Trash Can. Its extra wide opening (11.75 diagonal) allows disposal of larger debris and comes equipped with the most advanced infrared sensor technology on the market; opening the lid automatically when you approach within 6 inches, and closing it when you walk away.    Thanks to the automatic lid closing system, the built-in carbon filter can work its magic; eliminating and neutralize nasty odors effectively. The pre-installed Carbon Filter Gate (CFG) has a 3-dimensional surface area, maximizing the deodorizer's odor-absorption capabilities. The deodorizer is non-scented and environmental friendly, making it safe for use around children and pets, providing you with a cleaner and fresher home. The deodorizer can fight odors for 3 months before needing replacement.\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAmazon.com\nOnce you've tried the iTouchless Touchless Trashcan, you will never go back to the traditional or step-on trash can again. After all, your trashcan is your most-used everyday \"appliance,\" so why not make it easier, more pleasant, and a lot less messy to use?    iTouchless trashcan opens and closes without touching the bin. View larger.  About the Touchless Trashcan The 13-gallon, brushed stainless steel Touchless Trashcan is a patented product that's already widely recognized in Europe. Thousands have been sold on infomercials, QVC, and HSN home shopping channels. It also won the 2002 Invention Show, New Household Product Award. It is a 100 percent hands-free operated, wireless, lidded waste disposal system. The built-in Artificial Intelligent (AI) Smart-Chip knows when you need to open trash can, and it does all the openings and closings for you so you don't have to touch or step on anything. How it Works The Touchless Trashcan uses patented, invisible, and harmless infrared technology. Simply place your hand or debris about six inches away from the infrared sensor near the lid. It will open instantly when you approach and will close automatically in three seconds after debris has been released and your hand moves away. The lid will remain open if debris or your hand is within the 6-inch range of the infrared sensor. There are two buttons on the front to open and close the lid manually, and a easy to reach on/off switch on the back of the trashcan. The Benefits of the Touchless Trashcan This trashcan creates a germ free, odor free, automated environment. It keeps your hands clean while you are cooking or playing with your children. It also helps prevent contamination, which reduces the threat of certain illnesses and infections. Because the trashcan turns an ordinary chore into something fun, your kids will have fun throwing the trash away for you. In addition, the Touchless Trashcan outlasts most of the step-on and hand-touch cans. If you can't touch it, you can't break it! These cans have been opened 100,000 times in laboratory tests, and they're still going strong. In fact, if you open your can 20 times a day, it can last over 10 years. This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time. Technology Professionals recognize Touchless Trashcan as the next generation of waste receptacles. Its non-touch hygienic features meet the immediate needs in healthcare facilities and elderly homes. The new SilenX technology makes the closing of the lid even quieter while the \"eagle eye\" water-resistant sensor features reliable point-n-lock beam technology. In addition, the special energy saving design of Touchless Trashcan enables its four \"D\" size heavy duty batteries to support up to 10,000 consecutive openings and closings, or more than one year of use in non-frequent circumstances. There's also never a \"fallen bag\" problem with the Touchless Trashcan. The specially designed garbage bag retainer ring tightly holds the edges of the bag to prevent it from falling, and it seals the odors inside. You can use regular plastic garbage bags or even grocery bags, so there's no need to buy special garbage bags which many high-end garbage cans require. The Touchless Trashcan will improve the look of your kitchen, giving it an ultra-modern look and feel. It comes with one year limited manufacturer's warranty and a 60-day unconditional money back guarantee.  What's in the Box iTouchless touchless trashcan and garbage bag retainer ring.",

Once the equation is solved, the results are displayed on the second line, and you can use the four arrow keys on the front of the calculator to edit the original equation in any way you like for a recalculation. Better still, pressing the up arrow repeatedly lets you browse through a cache of dozens of previous calculations, meaning you can look back to see the answer to a problem.

This can be done by applying any type of sticker and seeing if it sticks well. Examples of surfaces that are not adhesive friendly: clothing, wool, beads.\n\nMagnetic surface\n\nMake sure to test if the surface on which you plan sticking the magnetic side of the magnets is magnetically receptive. This can be done by testing it out with any type of magnet. If that magnets sticks well to the surface it's magnetically receptive. Materials which are made up of aluminum or copper (and not iron) are not magnetically receptive for example.\n\nWeight\n\nOur rubber magnets are designed to hold light objects such as but not limited to postcards, business cards and small artwork in a cost-effective way.\u00a0Anything flat weighing 10 grams per attached magnet should not be a problem. For heavier items such as but not limited to whiteboards, blackboards and key racks, we recommend buyers to buy more expensive heavy-duty magnets such as neodymium magnets.",

Special features include the ability for each individual VESA plate to be level adjusted up and down by 0.8\" so your monitors will be perfectly aligned (see pictures). We also made mounting your monitors easy with detachable VESA plates that screw into your monitor and then slide back onto the frame of the stand. An optional bolt through grommet clamp is included with this stand. This has standard VESA 75x75mm and 100x100mm mounting holes.",

Why HP Paper Is Important Not all papers are created equal. Designed with each element of the HP printing process in mind, HP papers, toners, and inks are specially engineered to work together to deliver quality, reliable printing, as well as fade resistance, bolder blacks and more vibrant colors.  Because HP papers are specifically formulated to work with HP printers, it's important to select the right HP paper for every job to ensure a crisp, clean finished product.  Key HP Paper Features Check the label on HP paper packaging to find this key information: Finish Consider the look you want to achieve, and choose a finish that fits your needs:  Glossy: For color images that really pop, try printing on a paper with a glossy finish. Matte: If printing a document with text, such as a term paper or resume, a matte finish can make your text easier to read. Satin: A satin finish will give your photos a smooth, professional touch.  Brightness The brightness of your paper refers to the amount of light reflected from the surface of the paper, and is typically measured on a scale from 1 to 100. Print on brighter paper, such as HP Bright White Inkjet Paper, for higher contrast, crisper text, and a clean background for more vivid images. Weight Thickness (measured in millimeters) and weight (measured in pounds), refer to the sturdiness and crease-resistance of your paper. HP paper comes in a variety of different weights. You may try using a heavier paper for artwork or pieces that will be frequently handled, like cards or brochures. Heavier paper can also help formal, more substantial printed pieces, such as resumes and invitations, stand out from the crowd.    Size HP offers many kinds of paper in a variety of sizes, from standard 8.5\" x 11\" paper, to 4\" x 6\" and 5\" x 7\" photo paper, to specialty sizes such as wide format and legal paper. Not all printers can handle all kinds of paper, so before stocking up, check your printer manual for paper size and weight capabilities.  Choose Paper Suited To Specific Tasks Whether printing driving directions, invoices, snapshots for the fridge, or formal wedding invitations, HP has the paper you need to get the job done. Multipurpose Printing For basic home and office printing, a simple, multipurpose paper is your best bet. Many HP multipurpose papers now feature ColorLok technology for more vibrant colors, bolder blacks, and fewer smears. Engineered with special additives that chemically react with inkjet inks, ColorLok paper absorbs ink deeper into the paper while holding the pigment closer to the surface, delivering impeccable print quality every time.

Prioritize  Put the items you use most often closest to you. Store less frequently used items in cabinets, drawers, or files. If there is something you no longer need, just get rid of it.  3. Make the Most of Your Space with Rolodex Workspace Accessories  Whether you need help managing piles of paper, improving ergonomics, or organizing office supplies, the extensive collection of Rolodex workspace accessories can help keep your day-to-day from getting in the way so you can focus on what matters.  4. Designate a Place for Everything  Give everything a home so there is no question where to put items when not in use. Use a letter tray or wall file as an inbox for papers that haven't been filed yet. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to file all of the papers in your inbox.  5. Evaluate Your System  No system is ever perfect the first time, so don't be afraid to make adjustments to your organizational system as you go. The more effectively you can layout your system, the easier it will be to maintain.",

Simple Steps to Getting Organized 1. Stop and Think  What do you struggle with the most when it comes to being organized? What could you do differently to help overcome this challenge?  2. Prioritize  Put the items you use most often closest to you. Store less frequently used items in cabinets, drawers, or files. If there is something you no longer need, just get rid of it.  3. Make the Most of Your Space with Rolodex Workspace Accessories  Whether you need help managing piles of paper, improving ergonomics, or organizing office supplies, the extensive collection of Rolodex workspace accessories can help keep your day-to-day from getting in the way so you can focus on what matters.  4. Designate a Place for Everything  Give everything a home so there is no question where to put items when not in use. Use a letter tray or wall file as an inbox for papers that haven't been filed yet. At the end of the day, take 5 minutes to file all of the papers in your inbox.  5. Evaluate Your System  No system is ever perfect the first time, so don't be afraid to make adjustments to your organizational system as you go. The more effectively you can layout your system, the easier it will be to maintain.",

Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution. Microscopes can control magnification through a fixed focus, or through a range of adjustments. They can also utilize LED, fluorescent, and mirror light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Microscopes are widely used in education, lab research, biology, metallurgy, engineering, chemistry, manufacturing, and in the medical, forensic science, and veterinary industries.United Scope manufactures microscopy equipment and accessories under the brand name AmScope. The company, founded in 1996, is headquartered in Irvine, CA.What's in the Box?AmScope M30 microscopeShrimp hatcheryBrine shrimp eggsSpecimen slicerPetri dishPlastic tweezersPlastic scalpelPlastic spatulaNeedlePlastic stirring rodGraduated cylinderEosinGum media (bottle)Sea salt(5) Prepared slides(7) Blank slides(7) Slide covers(7) Statistical slide covers(7) Slide labels(2) Collecting vials(2) AA batteriesSpare LED bulbPlastic carrying case",

This self-adhesive chalkboard liner works like real chalkboards.  Apply the shelf liner to any smooth surface and start getting creative!  And if you need to make a change, just wipe it clean. With a self-adhesive backing, simply cut to size or shape, peel, and stick.  It works best on smooth, non-textured surfaces.  It can be used on smooth horizontal or vertical painted surfaces although it was not designed to be used as a wall paper.  Chalkboard liner can be removed leaving no sticky residue.  It can also be repositioned. Creative Uses Con-Tact Chalkboard Liner will put your creativity to the test!  Use in a conference room at school or work.  Use in your craft or sewing room to create your own decorative jar labels for storing sewing needs and craft items.  Use in the kitchen to label glass or ceramic jars and canisters.  Create a grocery list or notepad on the refrigerator.  Turn an old picture frame or mirror into a message board by covering the glass with self-adhesive chalkboard.  Create a schedule for medication on the medicine cabinet door or mirror in the bathroom.  Use in the garage to label cabinet doors, storage containers, or for a maintenance schedule board for the car.  Create a decorative wall message banner at a party.  Use in weddings to label the \"Just Married\" get-a-way car!    Create signs for garage and household sales. How to use: Self adhesive chalkboard works best on smooth non-textured solid surfaces.  The surface must be clean.  Use a liquid cleaner like glass cleaner to clean the surface and wait until the entire surface is dry before adhering your chalkboard liner.  Metal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain are all great mounting surfaces.  If the desired use is on a textured wall, try mounting the covering to a piece of Masonite first and then hang on the wall.  If you prefer to mount self-adhesive chalkboard to a textured wall, it will create a rough writing surface and potentially have poor adhesion.  You can mount self-adhesive chalkboard liner on any smooth wood surface.  To use, cut to size with scissors and then peel and stick.  For writing, use regular white or colored chalk.  To erase, a damp cloth works best.    Product features Works on most any clean, dry, and smooth surface Easily cuts to fit Backing paper is printed with grid for guiding straight cuts Repositionable Chalk not included",

Has a easy to remove white cover underneath where you just stash your key in there, and then place it down on the ground and it will blend in so good that you will never notice the difference between other rocks (just make sure you never lose the rock or get confused which rock it is ?..)   Inside of the rock is hollow so you can stack in there even more then 1 key if you have more to hide.   Great for geocaching fans.   Stone color is a mix of grey and brown.   Overall: Very much worth for everyone that uses a key for their apartment or office.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Gorilla Tape has taken duct tape to a new level. This double thick adhesive tape surpasses ordinary duct tapes, making the list of uses virtually endless. Made with double thick adhesive, strong reinforced backing, and a tough all-weather shell, it\u2019s the biggest, strongest, toughest thing ever to happen to duct tape. Gorilla Tape is manufactured with a highly concentrated rubber based adhesive \u2013 two to three times as thick as traditional duct tape. The result is a tape that fills gaps and penetrates rough surfaces. It sticks to rough and uneven surfaces, including wood, stone, stucco and brick, that ordinary duct tapes can't hold. To us, it\u2019s made the way tape should be: The Toughest on Planet Earth. Directions: Use like any other tape. Tear Gorilla Tape by hand or cut to size with a knife or scissors. It is important to clean the surface and brush off any loose particles and dirt before applying Gorilla Tape. Apply the tape carefully, smoothing out any pockets or rolls. That\u2019s it. Enjoy the strength and durability of Gorilla Tape! To retain adhesive quality, store Gorilla Tape in a cool, dry place. Keep out of direct sunlight. Try storing the tape vertically (rather than laying flat), on a hook or on wax paper. If you have multiple rolls, keep your excess supply wrapped until they\u2019re needed. Gorilla Tape works best at temperatures above 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C). For best results, always apply the tape at room temperature. If Gorilla Tape freezes, it will work just fine once it returns to room temperature. Gorilla Tape can be removed, but with some difficulty and it may leave some residue. To remove any excess residue, we recommend using the tape itself as a blotter. Gorilla Tape should not be used as an electrical tape. We\u2019ve found that Gorilla Tape will last a lot longer than regular duct tapes when it comes in contact with moisture.

Fine Quality and Dimensions These cards are printed on 250gsm thick paper, which is the same weight as most business cards. Our matte finish shows off the Art\u2019s texture, and because there is no gloss smudges and scratching are reduced. The finish on the inside of the card is also matte, and accepts all pen types which means ink won\u2019t run or smudge. Pencils works just as well.  The envelopes are a very nice pastel yellow with 110gsm thick paper. They are thick enough so you don\u2019t see the card art through the envelope. We don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise!   \u2022 Card Size: 5.75\u201d x 4.1\u201d \u2022 Envelopes: 5.9\u201d x 4.25\u201d \u2022 Packaged in a PVC box for protection during shipping, and storage  Botanical Style From our collection of over 100 illustrations we have chosen the 5 floral prints that our customers keep asking for.

In other words, the entire process is centrally controlled and it makes the quality control simple and well-organized; and helps to maintain the quality of all genuine Canon inks at a high level. All genuine Canon ink cartridges are designed for your easy printing of your beautiful prints.     Long-Lasting Beautiful Photos In order to provide longer-lasting and more beautiful vivid photo prints, Canon continues to develop genuine dye inks and genuine Canon photo papers specifically for PIXMA printers and take advantage of the superb printing ability of the \"FINE\" print head. ChromaLife100+ is a system to help preserve both long lasting beauty and durability of photos with the combination of genuine Canon dye inks and photo papers.     Print Crisp Text When printing text or a document, pigment black ink takes a prominent role to help deliver crisp and sharp text and characters on plain paper. New genuine Canon pigment black ink brings dense and crisp-and-sharp black text print to the output because the surface of the pigment in the ink has been chemically treated on the nanoscale using Canon original treatment methods and treating agent. These nanoscale technologies suppress unwanted light reflection to the print surface by settling pigment particles on the paper surface to effectively control the reflection, and results in delivering denser black print.      Automatic Ink Monitoring Genuine Canon ink tank equips LED to tell the user that ink level is now low and soon to be depleted, so that the user can prepare the replacement in advance. If the user does not replace the empty ink tank and keeps on printing, the print quality may deteriorate and fail to meet the standard for set printing conditions. LED flashes to inform users of which ink tank needs to be replaced. This helps to prevent users from incorrectly replacing ink tanks which contains enough ink to print.     CREATIVE PARK PREMIUM - Make Printing Fun CREATIVE PARK PREMIUM is a premium content service available exclusively to owners of select Canon PIXMA printers only when all of the software and the colors of genuine Canon inks are installed.

Having been released in November 2004 this mouse pad went through extensive testing by gaming professionals before its release and with their feedback the QcK+ was further developed, to make it the ultimate cloth pad every gamer desired. With the use of high quality cloth material, an optimized texture which guarantees both smoothness and glide and a specially designed non-slippery rubber base this pad blows away the competition and is a great choice not only for the hardcore gamer but also for graphic designers and others who use their mouse for extended periods of time. Because the QcK+ is a super sized mouse pad, it's perfect for people using low sensitivity, high resolutions or designers using two or more monitors. The SteelSeries QcK+ is compatible with all types of mice and is ideal for starters because of its great value.",

It\u2019s made out of a lightweight polyester thermoplastic which acts like clay when warm, but when it cools, it\u2019s a strong plastic. Unlike other products that once they dry they are locked in that shape forever, InstaMorph can be reheated over and over again and re-molded into any number of configurations.Follow these simple instructions to get started using InstaMorph!\n\n1. Heat some water to approximately 150 degrees F.\n2. Pour InstaMorph pellets into the water.\n3. Wait approximately two minutes or until white InstaMorph pellets turn clear and stick together.\n4. Remove from the water and get rid of any remaining liquid between the pellets.\n5. Form into desired shape with your hands, tools, molds, or any other means necessary.\n6. Once you\u2019ve got your InstaMorph creation finalized, let it cool to room temperature and put it to use. It will turn an opaque white color when it's fully cooled\n\nNote: you can use other methods for heating up your InstaMorph, such as using a heat gun or other heat source. \n\n\n\u00a0Ideal for lots of differnet projects and all skill levels\n\nMold it with your hands, tools, or press around an object to make a mold.\nInstaMorph can be painted, machined, carved or attached to other materials.\nWhen warm, InstaMorph will stick to itself. Reheat it and \"glue\" peices together to make larger, more complex projects.\n\nProduct UsesCreate props, masks, or other costume pieces for Halloween or theater.\n\nMake your own action figures or accessories.Make custom cases or stands for the latest electronic gadgets.\n\nMold around existing handles or grips for an easy ergonomic solution.Makes excellent brackets, parts, molds, or housings for your next project.\n\nIdeal for prototypers or makers who want a strong, reusable compound.",

WRITING PENCIL: 6-8mm COLORED PENCIL: 9-12mm CARPENTER PENCIL: 10mm DUAL PROTECTION FEATURE\uff1a Auto-stop safety feature prevents this pencil sharpener from operating if the shaving box is open.\u00a0 The safety cover for 9-12mm sharpening hole prevents the kids inserting their fingers into the hole, which makes it an ideal choice for young kids. \u2764 Note: 6-8mm hole is smaller and used more often than larger hole. It's convenient to use 6-8mm hole without a cover. So the pencil sharpener doesn\u2019t have a cover for the smaller hole. USB & BATTERY POWERED:\u00a0 Use it as a battery operated pencil sharpener with 4 x AA Batteries (not included). Just take it with your colored pencils and go painting anywhere you like! Or use it as an electronic pencil sharpener via USB cable (included). The power sources can be a computer, power bank and phone charger. REPLACEABLE CUTTING BLADES:\u00a0 Removable cutting blades and concise design make it easy to clean up. The pencil sharpener has a lifespan of over 200 times sharpening and we also provide two extra cutting blades as backup to extend the lifespan of the sharpener. HOW TO USE \u25cf Insert the pencil into the appropriate hole \u25cf Hold the pencil \u25cf Take it out after 6-10 seconds  After using several times, you will find the best sharpening effect you want and the most suitable time you need. As you can control the sharpening time, it doesn't keep sharpening unnecessarily. 100% SATISFACTION:\u00a0 100% customer service is guaranteed: Unconditionally refund or free replacement if defective or any quality problems, life-time friendly customer service.",
